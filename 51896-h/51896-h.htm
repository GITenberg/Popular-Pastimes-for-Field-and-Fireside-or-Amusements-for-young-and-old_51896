<p class="dc08">I WOULD like to make a few suggestions on
“home influence,” before I commence a list of
amusements. They may be superfluous; if so,
I trust you will pardon me.</p>

<p>All parents, I am sure, must feel a deep interest
in this subject, and I think will agree with
me that judicious praise is quite as necessary
in the training of a child as wholesome correction.
But if we wish our children to have
a genuine love for us, and our homes, we must sympathize
with them, and never forget we were once children, and loved
childish things.</p>

<p>Mothers have by nature far more sympathy and patience
than most fathers. Some fathers are apt to think that home
is only a place in which to eat, sleep, and be generally comfortable;
but as to giving any of their valuable time to
entertaining their own children, why, the very idea is preposterous!
A wife is presuming to expect it! Let me appeal
to your selfish instincts. You all wish to be loved and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
revered, and are gratified if your children are attentive to
your comforts. Can you expect such manifestations, unless
you set them an example, and prove by a real interest in
their pleasures, that you sincerely love them? Is it not better
to devote at least an hour a day to your children, than to
spend every moment in earning money for them, which,
unless you rightly direct and train them, will surely prove
their ruin?</p>

<p>There is no time in the day when home is so pleasant as at
twilight, or in the early evening hour. Then all are gathered
(or should be) together at home. In the country it is after
tea; in cities, particularly New York, it is after dinner.
Then, I entreat you, fathers and mothers, assemble your
children around you, devote your time for an hour or two in
being children with them, join heartily in all their plays; let
them tell what has interested them during the day; draw
them out, and encourage them to open their little hearts
freely and confide in you.</p>

<p>Some think it childish and silly to play games. Yet if we
would only keep our hearts young and happy, we should
retain our youth longer, and love our friends and homes better.
A good hearty laugh is wholesome.</p>

<p>Mothers, I intreat you to train your own children. Do
not leave them to servants. Hire them to relieve you of the
care of your house, and to do your sewing; but give your
time to your children. “Verily, you will have your reward.”</p>

<p>I have compiled this book to assist you in your home amusements.
May it carry to your home circle that spirit of
enjoyment which is natural to the young heart, and which
should not be absent from the more mature.</p>

<h2 class="p4">Croquet.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="dc1" src="images/dc.jpg" width="114" height="200" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="dc13">CROQUET has been for several years one
of the most popular pastimes in England,
and is now very justly receiving a large
and rapidly increasing share of attention
in this country. It is unmistakably a game
of <i>science</i>, in which the brain, as well as
the muscles and nerves, has an essential
part to perform,&mdash;thus very closely resembling
billiards, to which game it is in some
respects superior, in that it is a more social game, and gives
an opportunity for healthful open air exercise.</p>

<p>Unlike most of out-of-door sports, it does not require the
possession of great strength or powers of endurance, or severe
muscular exertion on the part of the player. Excellence in
it is almost equally attainable to the weakly and delicate as
to the healthy and robust. Old and young meet on its arena
on more nearly equal terms than in any other known game
of skill. A “correct eye,” steady hands and nerves, and
good judgment, are the essential qualifications for a good
player, and the possession of these advantages of course is
not dependent upon the age, sex, or condition of the person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>And it may perhaps be considered as the chief excellence
of this game that it gives this opportunity, which very few
other games, combining scientific play and physical exercise,
afford, for persons of the opposite sexes and disparity of age
to join in one common amusement. It should be a matter
of congratulation to all to see the rapidly increasing popularity
of any healthful open air sport in this country.</p>

<p>We predict for Croquet a success wider in this than it has
reached in any other country. When we work or fight, we
work and fight harder than any other people, and we should
be as enthusiastic in our play.</p>

<p>In preparing this chapter on Croquet we have endeavored
to explain the general principles of the game, and to present
a code of rules, simple, concise, and shorn as far as possible
of technicalities of expression, but comprehensive enough to
include all points necessary to a thorough understanding of
the game.</p>

<p>In Rules of the Game, explanatory remarks are enclosed in
brackets.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/a2.jpg" width="200" height="39"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p class="psh">MATERIALS OF THE GAME.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A complete</span> set of Croquet consists of <i>eight balls, eight
mallets, ten iron bridges, and two posts</i>.</p>

<p>The balls should be about ten inches in circumference, perfectly
spherical, and should weigh about eight ounces. They
should be designated by different colors, either by painting
the entire surface of the ball, or by a stripe of the color
merely. But the first method is much to be preferred, as a
ball needs all the protection it can have to preserve it from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the effects of the weather, and for this purpose nothing is
better than good oil paint and varnish. There is a universal
predisposition towards large balls by all novices in the game;
but experience will invariably give the preference to a ball
not more than ten inches in circumference, if of rock maple
or birch, and if of box-wood, not more than nine and one-half
inches.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-015.jpg" width="100" height="593"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="cf"><p class="pc100">MALLET.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The mallet head should be about 2⅜ inches in diameter, and
4¼ inches long, shaped somewhat like a dice-box; and the
handle 33 inches long, <span class="small"><sup>15</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> of an inch in diameter in
the largest part, and ⅝ of an inch in the smallest.
It is customary to paint some portion of the mallets to
correspond to the colors on the balls. This is a very
great advantage in distinguishing the different players
and assisting the memory to connect them with their
respective balls, and we much prefer it; but some players
prefer to leave the mallets undistinguished, and
to allow each player to select his own,&mdash;choosing such
weight, size and length as he may desire&mdash;and perhaps
there is no objection to this. A feeble or delicate person
may not be able to play as well with a mallet of the
standard size as his opponent, and thus will be upon
an unequal footing with him at the outset; while, if
each selects such as is suitable to his or her condition,
all will be satisfactorily equipped, and, of course, upon
equal terms, as far as the implements are concerned.
For balls and mallet heads good rock maple is the
most desirable of all our native woods, and hickory is the best
for mallet handles. Box-wood is very good for mallet heads,
but is too heavy for balls. Box-wood mallet heads and good
rock maple balls, well painted, make an elegant and superior set,
and are preferable to a complete box-wood set, while rosewood
and lignum-vitæ balls are little better than iron, and entirely
unfit to use.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The bridges should be made of iron wire about 5/16 of an
inch in diameter, in form like an ox-bow. The width of the
bridge should be equal to the circumference
of the ball, and the hight such that
when firmly set it will stand out of the
ground a distance equal to its width.
They should be uniform in color. White
is best, as it is more easily seen, and contrasts
more pleasingly with the green of
the turf. Some have adopted the practice
of painting them of different colors, but
the reason assigned seems not to be a good
one, and experience almost unanimously pronounces in favor
of a uniform light color.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-016.jpg" width="200" height="263"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="cf"><p class="pc200">THE BRIDGE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>One manufacturer has adopted and patented the happy
idea of galvanizing or plating the iron bridges with zinc,
which gives them a <i>permanent</i> light color, and at the same
time perfectly preserves them from rust.</p>

<p>Some writers assert that withs or firkin hoops answer very
well for bridges. They may answer as a very poor substitute,
but a good croquet player would no sooner play with such
materials than a billiard player with a slack rope for a cushion
or an umbrella for a cue. In many of the scientific “shots”
of the game, the player calculates upon the rigidity of the
bridges, and an iron bridge, when set in sandy soil, is at best
none too rigid; and with loose or springy bridges the game
loses much of its attraction to a good player.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-017.jpg" width="100" height="248"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="cf"><p class="pc100">THE POST.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The posts should be about 28 inches long, 1½ inches in diameter
in the largest part, and pointed so as to be driven into
the ground. They should have rings painted on them corresponding
to the colors of the balls, and of such width that the
bottom ring will be as high from the ground as the top of the
bridges. Thus, supposing the post to be 28 inches long, commencing
at the top, make each ring 1¼ inches wide. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
will occupy 10 inches, and hence allow the posts to be driven
into the ground 8 inches, and still have the lowest
color so high from the turf that it can be easily
seen from any portion of the ground. The order
of the colors on the post is not essential so long
as the light and dark colors alternate; but the
two uppermost colors belong to the chiefs of the
two sides, and therefore most properly should be
black and white, as those are the best representatives
of dark and light colors. The exact arrangement
of the succeeding colors is immaterial, but
the following is very good, commencing at the top:</p>

<table cellspacing="0" id="t01" summary="t01">

 <tr>
  <td class="tbl1">1. Black.<br />2. White.<br />3. Blue.<br />4. Yellow.</td>
  <td class="tbl2">5. Brown.<br />6. Red.<br />7. Green.<br />8. Pink.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1">As the order of the colors on the posts governs that of the
play, and since those on each side play alternately, it follows
that in a game of eight the dark balls, black, blue, brown,
and green, are matched against the light ones, white, yellow,
red and pink.</p>

<p>Many devices have been suggested for marking the bridges
when run, such as clips or markers, painting the bridges different
colors, &amp;c., &amp;c., but they have all proved to be useless,
as a player who is interested in the game will remember his
own position more easily than he will remember to change the
marker.</p>

<p class="psh">THE GROUND.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> contemplating the preparation of a Croquet ground, the
first question that occurs is, how much and what kind of
ground is necessary. The size of the ground, as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
distance between the bridges, is governed very much by the
taste and accommodation of the owner.</p>

<p>A model Croquet ground has been defined as an elliptical
field one hundred feet long and sixty feet wide, with the
bridges from nine to twelve feet apart; but persons possessed
of only a limited plot of ground need not conclude that the
above dimensions are absolutely necessary, for a very interesting
game may be played on ground not more than sixty
feet long and thirty feet wide, with the bridges from six to
eight feet apart. The bounds may be imaginary lines defined
by corner bounds, or they may be walks or other natural
bounds suggested by the nature of the ground; or if a plot
is prepared expressly for the purpose, a ditch about eight
inches wide, and six inches deep, well turfed is probably the
best bound that can be made.</p>

<p>A smooth, closely cut turf is always to be chosen, and is
improved by a thorough rolling with a very heavy roller, or,
if that is not available, a few hours’ work with a heavy mall
will bring the ground into very good condition. Next to
having the turf smooth, the most important point is to have
the ground level; and yet a very good game can be played
on an uneven or sloping ground, if in making the strokes and
determining the necessary force and direction, a proper calculation
is made with reference to the condition of the surface
over which the ball is to pass. It in fact shows more skill to
play a good game upon a poor ground than upon a perfect
one.</p>

<p class="psh">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE GAME.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> players being designated captains or chiefs, one for
each side, sides are chosen in the usual manner. The privilege
of first choice of players is very conveniently decided between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the chiefs by each placing his ball under the first bridge
and striking for the starting post; the one who thus drives his
ball nearest the post gaining the first choice.</p>

<p>The chief who has the first choice takes the ball corresponding
in color with the top of the post, and the other chief the
next ball according to the order of the colors on the posts,
while the remaining balls are given to the other players in the
order in which they are chosen. (See remark under Rule II.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-019.jpg" width="400" height="348"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Eight persons can play, but a game of four or six is the
most interesting. If four or more play, each player uses but
one ball; but if only two play, the game is improved by
each player taking two balls and playing them alternately as
usual. If there be an odd number of players&mdash;either three,
five or seven&mdash;the players play against each other individually,
or one person takes two balls and plays each in its
proper turn.</p>

<p>Assuming that each player has a ball and a mallet, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
bridges are arranged in either of the three positions given in
diagrams Nos. 1, 2 and 3, we now come to the mode of playing
the game. The object is to drive the balls through all
the bridges, in the direction indicated by the dotted lines on
the diagrams, and to strike the two posts. The side, all of
whose members succeed in performing this feat first, wins the
game. Now although this is the chief object of the game,
yet the act from which it derives its title, to wit: “Croquet,”
is of much greater importance than would at first be imagined.
If a player hit with his ball any of the others, he is
allowed to place his own against the ball he has struck, and
setting his foot upon his own ball, he hits it with the mallet,
and the force of the blow drives off the other ball while the
playing ball remains stationary. As a player is allowed to
Croquet either friend or foe, it is evident that he can do a
great deal of damage or service, according to his inclination,
since he is at liberty to drive the ball in any direction he
pleases.</p>

<p>The Roquet-Croquet is an operation still more interesting
than the Croquet as it is susceptible of much greater skill in
its execution. This is accomplished the same as the Croquet,
except that instead of holding one ball firmly by placing the
foot upon it, both balls are left free to be driven together by
the blow of the mallet. By practice and a skillful placing
of the balls a stroke may be made that will cause the balls
to diverge in any forward directions the player may desire.</p>

<p>In commencing a game, the first chief places his ball one-third
the distance from the starting post to the first bridge,
and endeavors, by striking it with the end of his mallet’s
head, to drive it through the first bridge. If he succeeds, he
continues his turn and attempts to send the ball through the
second bridge, and then through the third, for driving the
ball through a bridge, or hitting another ball, generally imparts
the privilege of an additional stroke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>When one ball driven by a blow of the mallet hits another,
it is said to make <i>Roquet</i> on that ball.</p>

<p>When the first player, who should be black, has missed,
white goes on, and the other players follow in the order of the
colors on the posts, and very soon comes the opportunity to
use the great advantages of the Croquet and Roquet-Croquet.
Often when a player has his ball in a good position in front
of a bridge, another will hit it, and then by Croquet or Roquet-Croquet
drive it to the other end of the ground, compelling
it perhaps to take two or three turns before it can regain
its former position. Occasionally two or three balls lie
close together, and one is struck by a ball which was some
distance off. The player is now allowed to place his ball by
the side of the one it has struck, thus gaining position near
the others, so that after croqueting it he is almost sure of hitting
the others.</p>

<p>As an example of the use of the <i>Roquet-Croquet</i>, we will
take diagram No. 1, and suppose that white plays with success
through the first two bridges, and that black lies somewhere
beyond the second bridge. Now if there was no other
ball near, it would be impossible for white to continue to play
and pass through the third bridge, because it will require one
stroke to get in position for that bridge: but if white can
<i>Roquet</i> black, then she can <i>Roquet-Croquet</i> with black up in
front of the third bridge, and then, as the Roquet gives another
stroke, play through the third bridge and perhaps
through the fourth and fifth. If below the fifth she should
find, say the brown ball, to <i>Roquet-Croquet</i> with, it would be
possible to get in front of No. 6, and then down to the turning
post and hitting that return up through No. 6. Here the
brown ball may again be roqueted, and then roquet-croqueted,
into position for No. 8, and so on. This of course could only
happen if <i>white</i> was an extra player and the other balls were
in very favorable positions, but it serves as an illustration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the use of this very valuable stroke. The player who reaches
the turning-post first, has great advantages for a time, for as
soon as he touches it, he commences his return journey, and
meeting the other players on their way to the farthest point
of their journey, he is able to croquet them and considerably
impede their progress.</p>

<p>When a player has passed through all the bridges, he becomes
what is called in the technical language of Croquet, a
rover, and is privileged to rove about all over the ground,
croqueting his friends and foes. It is therefore obvious that
a good player can prove, when thus situated, of immense
advantage to his side, and should generally avoid hitting the
starting post till all on his side have passed through the last
bridge. The excitement towards the end of the game, often
becomes intense, and each stroke is watched with the keenest
interest. Gradually, one by one, the players hit the post,
until perhaps only two remain, and now occurs an opportunity
for skillful play. The object of both is first to hit the
post, and failing in that, to keep as far off his adversary as
he can. Each endeavors, at the same time drawing nearer to
the great object in view, to keep the post between his and
the other ball. At length one plays at the post, misses it,
and sends his ball near his adversary, who first hits it, next
croquets it away, and then strikes the post, and wins the
victory.</p>

<p>The figures marked on this diagram are intended merely to
furnish a relative scale of distances. Thus with these distances
the posts are 53 feet apart,
which is perhaps more than is
desirable, unless the ground
is very perfect, or the players
experts.</p>

<p>The course of the ball is
indicated by the dotted lines,
and the arrows show the direction
in which the balls
proceed on the round. It
will be observed that bridge
No. 3 is to the left of No. 2.
As represented in this diagram,
bridges 3 and 10 are
set a little in advance of 2,
and 6 a little in advance of
5  and 8. Some players prefer
that 10, 2 and 3 should
be in a straight line, and the
same with 8, 6 and 5. We
prefer to have 3 and 10
enough in advance of 2 to
make it just possible for an
expert by a <i>very</i> superior
stroke to run No. 2 and get
position for No. 3 at one
blow, and the same with 5,
6  and 8. In short, we would
have the arrangement such
that it is not absolutely <i>impossible</i>
for a player to make the grand round in one tour,
without the aid of the roquet. This of course would very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
rarely be accomplished,&mdash;never, except by extraordinarily
skillful play,&mdash;yet it should
be made possible, but very

from 3 to 4, the ball
must keep to the left of 4,

from the outside of the game;
a much more difficult arrangement

somewhat more difficult than

<p>In this, the third diagram, it will be seen that the two center
side bridges are done away with, and that one is placed in
the center of the ground instead;
but although in the
play we now require one
bridge less than in the former
diagram, yet the player will
have to pass through the
same number of bridges as
before, since he travels twice
through the bridge in the
center, once on his way to
the turning post, and once
on his return. This is the
best arrangement of bridges
for a four-handed game.
As the player’s knowledge
of Croquet increases, many
other positions will suggest
themselves; but those we

and are the diagrams
in general use at the present

<p class="psh">RULES OF THE GAME.</p>

<p class="psh font1 p2">Striking the Ball.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">At</span> the commencement of the game the ball should be
placed on a line drawn from the starting post to the center of
the first bridge, and at a distance from the starting post, equal
to one-third the distance from the post to the bridge.</p>

<p>[The rule usually given, i. e., to place the ball a mallet’s
length from the post is very well for a large ground where the
distance from post to bridge is nine or ten feet, but for a small
ground it brings the ball too near the first bridge.]</p>

<p>1.  In striking, the mallet should be used with one hand, and
the striker should stand on one side of, and not behind the ball.</p>

<p>2.  The ball <i>must be struck</i> and not pushed&mdash;a push never
being allowable under any circumstances; and the blow must be
given with the <i>face</i>&mdash;never with the side&mdash;of the mallet head.</p>

<p>[A ball can never get into such a position on a croquet-ground
that it cannot be struck in some direction, and if it is
in a bad position it is either the fault or the misfortune of the
player owning the ball&mdash;which he is not to be allowed to rectify
by a push, for that would sometimes be rewarding bad play.]</p>

<p>3.  Whenever the mallet hits the ball, if it moves it however
slightly, it must be considered a stroke.</p>

<p>4.  The player may if he wholly miss his ball, strike at it
again.</p>

<p class="p2">II.  The game is opened by the chief holding the ball corresponding
in color with the top of the post, and the players
on the two sides follow alternately according to the order of
the colors on the posts.</p>

<p>[The playing must necessarily be in the order of the colors
on the post. But on some grounds the chief is allowed to assign
the balls to the several players on his side according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
his own choice; thus according to this rule the chief is not
compelled to play the first ball. We do not advise this practice
as there is generally some real or fancied difference in the
mallets and hence a chief is liable to offend some one in the
distribution of the materials. There are other objections
which we have not space to discuss.]</p>

<p>1.  A player who misses the first bridge is called a booby,
and at his next turn must strike his ball from the position to
which it last rolled.</p>

<p>[The above rule is based upon the almost universal practice
of the best players in this country. The following is gaining
favor in England: “A ball missing the first bridge must be
immediately picked up and played from the starting spot, at
its next turn.” Both practices have peculiar advantages over
the other, which we have not space to discuss.]</p>

<p>2.  A roquet made <i>upon</i>, or <i>by</i>, a booby does not entitle
the player to an extra stroke; neither can a booby croquet or
be croqueted.</p>

<p>3.  If any ball is played out of its proper turn and discovered
before the play of another ball has commenced, the
misplayed ball may be returned to its original place, or permitted
to remain in that to which it has rolled, at the option
of the chief of the opposing side. But if the mistake is
discovered before the player has finished his turn and the misplay
be allowed, the misplayer shall be permitted to finish his
turn. If the chief does not permit the misplay, the misplayed
ball shall be returned to its original place, and any damages
sustained or advantages gained by either side shall be canceled.
If the misplay is not discovered before the play of
another ball commences, or is allowed, the misplayer cannot
use his next turn as he has anticipated it.</p>

<p>4.  If a player use a wrong ball, all the balls moved by
such play must be returned to their former position, and the
misplayer lose his turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh font1 p2">Running a Bridge.</p>

<p class="p2">III.  A player continues to play so long as he makes a
point in the game.</p>

<p>1.  Making a point is running one or more bridges, striking
the turning-post in order, or performing the roquet (except
on a booby, or on a ball the second time in one tour
without making an intervening <i>step</i>.)</p>

<p>2.  A player is allowed but one extra stroke, even though
he make roquet and run one or more bridges at one stroke.</p>

<p>3.  If a player makes two steps at one stroke, he may
take position one mallet’s length or less, in any direction from
where the ball rested.</p>

<p>4.  If a player makes three steps at one stroke, he may
take position as above up to two mallet lengths or less.</p>

<p class="p2">IV. The bridges must be passed through in their regular
order in the direction of the course. (This is called running
a bridge.)</p>

<p>1.  A ball runs a bridge when it passes through it in order
and course, by a direct blow, by roquet, roquet-croquet, croquet
or concussion. Hence, for a player to drive his ball
through a bridge out of its regular order, or from the wrong
side counts no more than to pass over any other part of the
field.</p>

<p>2.  A ball is not through its bridge when the handle of the
mallet laid across the two piers of the bridge upon the side
from whence the ball came, touches the ball without moving
the bridge.</p>

<p>3.  A ball passing under its bridge in the wrong direction
is not in position to run the bridge until it has passed clear
through according to the foregoing rule.</p>

<p>4.  A ball lying under a bridge is not in position for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
bridge if it has been so placed by the hand for the purpose of
croquet or roquet-croquet, no matter from what position it may
have been taken.</p>

<p>[If the ball was taken from the back of the bridge, it would
not be in position, having come from the wrong side, as
above. Now if it should be allowed that a ball may be taken
from the front of the bridge and placed under the bridge
without losing position, as would at first seem proper, then the
question immediately arises as to a ball when taken from a
position directly on a line with the two piers of the bridge,
thus coming from neither front nor back. This question can
rarely be settled without dispute, to avoid which we have
considered the adoption of the above rule as most judicious.]</p>

<p class="p2">V. Tolling the <i>turning</i> post is in all respects equivalent
to running a bridge, but the post may be tolled from any
quarter.</p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh font1 p2">Striking Out.</p>

<p>VI. A ball, after it has run all the bridges, may hit the
starting post either by a blow from its owner’s mallet, by roquet,
roquet-croquet, croquet or concussion, and is then a
<i>dead ball</i>, and must be <i>immediately</i> removed from the field.</p>

<p>1.  A player who having run all the bridges strikes the
starting post, is out of the game, his turn is omitted, and the
play goes on as before. If, instead of striking the post, he
continues to play, he is called a <i>rover</i>.</p>

<p>2.  When all the balls on one side have made the grand
round and hit the starting post, that side has won the game.</p>

<p>[Some authors on Croquet require the ball to be placed on
the <i>spot</i> or starting point before continuing play as a rover.
But this rule seems to be entirely arbitrary&mdash;useless&mdash;and to
have been adopted for no sufficient reason.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh font1 p2">The Rover.</p>

<p>VII. If the roquet-croquet is allowed to all players alike,
the rover is governed entirely by the same laws as other players.</p>

<p>1. Therefore, a rover having completed the grand round,
and having no other steps to make (except <i>stepping out</i>,
when of course his play ceases,) can only acquire the right
to continuance of play by the roquet. He may (after roquet
upon it) croquet or roquet-croquet each ball once only during
a tour. Roquet upon a ball the second time during a tour
does not entitle him to a continuance of play.</p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh font1 p2">Roquet.</p>

<p>VIII. A ball roquets another when it comes in contact
with it by a direct blow of the mallet, or rebounds upon it
after the blow, from any fixed obstacle of the ground or from
another ball.</p>

<p>1. A ball having roqueted another ball, except a booby,
is at liberty to croquet or roquet-croquet it or proceed on its
round; providing that the playing ball has not already in that
tour roqueted that same ball since making a step on the round.</p>

<p>2. A ball may roquet another ball twice between two consecutive
steps, but the second roquet does not entitle the
player to a continuance of play.</p>

<p>3. Any player in his turn is at liberty at any time to
make roquet on <i>any</i> ball on the ground.</p>

<p>4. Roquet does not entitle a booby to a continuance of play.</p>

<p>5. Roquet on a booby does not entitle the playing ball to
a continuance of play.</p>

<p>6. A ball having made roquet and declined the croquet,
may continue its play either from the position to which it has
rolled after the roquet, or from the side of the roqueted ball.</p>

<p>7. If a ball roquet another and thereby gain the privilege<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of croquet, and afterwards, at the same blow, run a
bridge; it may croquet the roqueted ball, then proceed to roquet
it again, then croquet again and proceed on its round;
or waiving either or both croquets, or the last roquet and croquet,
may proceed on its round.</p>

<p>[Thus supposing the playing ball roquets a ball that it has
not roqueted since making a step, and <i>afterwards</i> at the same
blow runs a bridge; it of course has a right to croquet the
roqueted ball; then as that roquet was made <i>before</i> the playing
ball run its bridge there is no reason why it cannot again
roquet and croquet the same ball. But had the playing ball
<i>first</i> run a bridge and afterwards at the same blow roqueted a
ball then it can have but one croquet according to Rule IX.]</p>

<p>8. The continuance of play is gained by virtue of the
roquet, and not of the croquet. The croquet is merely a
privilege consequent upon the roquet. Therefore to waive a
croquet does not terminate the play. This principle once fixed
in the mind will avoid much confusion in understanding and
interpreting the rules.</p>

<p>[One author on Croquet, assumes to propound a set of rules
on double points which are entirely new and at variance with
all previously established principles of the game, inasmuch as
they allow a player to waive any point made or privilege
gained. It is an established fact in Croquet that a player
may waive any <i>privilege</i> that he has acquired&mdash;but it is also
as well established that a <i>step</i> once made can not be taken
back. The beauty of Croquet is in a great degree due to its
simplicity, and the granting of the above right to players adds
one-half to the difficulties of the game, without adding in the
least to its interest. A game of Croquet in which all the
players except the rover are denied the privilege of roquet-croquet,
and in which the right to waive a step is introduced,
becomes at once twice as intricate, requires double the rules
to explain it, and loses one-half its interest.]</p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh font1 p2">The Croquet and Roquet-Croquet.</p>

<p>IX. A player may croquet or roquet-croquet any number
of balls consecutively; but he can croquet or roquet-croquet
only those balls on which he has made roquet, and roquet on
the same ball the second time in one tour without an intervening
step does not entitle the player to a croquet.</p>

<p>1. If a player in the act of croqueting does not <i>separate</i>
the balls, he is at liberty to take the stroke over again.</p>

<p>[Instead of the above the following rule is often given. A
croquet is completed when the mallet makes a perceptible
(that is an audible) blow against the croqueting ball, whether
that to be croqueted move from its place or not. This rule
gives rise to frequent disputes whether the blow was perceptible
or not, and is not as generally acceptable as the one we
have given.]</p>

<p>2. If a player in executing the roquet-croquet does not
move the croqueted ball from its position, his tour of play
ceases, unless by the same stroke he makes a point.</p>

<p>[If it is in dispute whether or not the ball has been moved as
above required, the question shall be decided by the umpire if
there be one, if not, by the chief of the side opposing the player.
Some authors allow the roquet-croquet to the rover only&mdash;but
as it is one of the most scientific operations of the game,
the majority of players are not willing to give it exclusively
to the rover, especially when it is considered that a person
who is able to become an early rover, will naturally have advantage
enough without any extra favors. Further, the argument
that the universal use of the roquet-croquet tends to
perceptibly prolong the game has been proved by actual test
to be without foundation.]</p>

<p>3. If a ball is croqueted either through its own bridge or
upon the turning or starting post when in order, a point so
made holds good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>4.  In making ricochet the player is at liberty to croquet
either a part or all of the balls roqueted; but the order of
croquet must be that of the ricochet,&mdash;the player, however,
has only one additional stroke, and not one for each ball he
has roqueted.</p>

<p>5.  If a ball when croqueted or driven through its own
bridge from the rear roll back through the bridge, it has not
run that bridge.</p>

<p>[This rule is based upon the principle that all questions as
to position can only be satisfactorily determined when the ball
is not in motion. In the case put it would frequently be impossible
to decide whether the ball when it began to roll back
was in position or not.]</p>

<p class="p2">X.  The laws that govern Croquet all apply to Roquet-Croquet,
except as to points for which special rules are herein
given.</p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh font1 p2">The Flinch.</p>

<p>XI.  If a ball flinch in the execution of the croquet, it
is considered as merely an accidental roquet-croquet, and subject
to the same laws. In this case of course any point made
or advantage gained by either ball holds good.</p>

<p>[By adopting this rule all unpleasant difference of opinion
as to the proper positions of the balls is avoided, and as the
origin of the roquet-croquet was this very practice of placing
the foot lightly upon the playing ball and then allowing both
balls to be moved together&mdash;there seems to be no objection to
the rule.]</p>

<p>1.  The above rule only applies in a game where the roquet-croquet
is allowed to all players.</p>

<p>2.  In case the roquet-croquet is only allowed to the
rover, the following rule applies:  If the player’s ball flinch
in executing the croquet, he forfeits the remainder of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
tour, and no point made by a flinching ball is valid, and the
balls are considered as accidentally displaced and are replaced
in accordance with the rule applying to accidentally displaced
balls.</p>

<p class="p2">XII.  A ball accidentally displaced must be returned, by
the chief of the side opposed to the person displacing it, to
the place where it was lying before the play proceeds.</p>

<p class="p2">XIII.  If a ball be hit off the ground it is to be placed
<i>at once</i>, and before the play proceeds, twelve inches within
the limit of the boundary and at a point nearest to where it
stopped, which of course causes the ball to be brought in
<i>square</i> with the boundary.</p>

<p class="p2">XIV. If a ball in its progress over the ground, be interrupted
by the person or mallet of an enemy the ball may be
placed by the chief of the side owning the ball, in such position
as he may judge it would have rested had it not been
interrupted in its progress. If interrupted by the person or
mallet of a friend the ball may be placed by the chief of the
<i>opposing side</i> in such position as he may judge it would have
rested.</p>

<p><i>A person not taking part in the game, should never be
within the bounds of a croquet ground when a game is in
progress</i>&mdash;but should such person accidentally be in such a
position and either displace a ball, or interrupt it in its progress&mdash;such
person shall be considered as an enemy to the
owner of the ball&mdash;and the ball be replaced according to
rules XII. and XIV.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p class="psh p2">SUGGESTIONS TO BEGINNERS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keep your temper</span>&mdash;<i>and remember when your turn comes</i>.</p>

<p>Make good use of the privilege of croquet and roquet-croquet,
and not consider it the sole object of the game to run
the bridges,&mdash;and yet it is not well to too much neglect the
bridges, as they must all be run before you can become a
rover.</p>

<p>Practice the roquet-croquet whenever an opportunity offers, as
it is susceptible of more scientific playing than any other stroke.</p>

<p>Accustom yourself to be guided strictly according to established
rules as far as you are informed on the subject.</p>

<p>Do not attempt to use a kind of push and call it a stroke
although it may not be expressly forbidden in some manual
of croquet.</p>

<p>Avoid acquiring the habit of standing behind the ball and
holding the mallet in a perpendicular position with both hands
when making a stroke, even though you play with those who
do not object to the practice, as it will not be allowed on any
well-regulated croquet ground. In making a stroke grasp
your mallet firmly; strike squarely&mdash;take care that your
wrist does not turn or twist, (unless you wish to give a twist
to your ball,) and after getting your aim look rather at your
mark than at your ball when giving the blow. After calculating
distance, direction, &amp;c., there is no more use in looking
at your ball except to be sure you can hit it, than in throwing
a stone, to look at your hand, rather than the mark.</p>

<p>If the enemy have an expert rover it is generally advisable
to use every effort to strike him out.</p>

<p>As an offset to this method of play it is often advisable to
neglect to make the last bridge till near the close of the game,
as in this way you can venture as near the starting post as
you please without the fear of being deaded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>It is often the case that you and an enemy may both be in
position for the last bridge. In such a case as a general rule
roquet him, then croquet or roquet-croquet through the bridge,
roquet again and croquet him against the starting post, thus
depriving the other side of a rover, and gaining the advantage
of bringing two of your own side into consecutive play.</p>

<p>Leave your own ball as near your friend and as far from an
enemy as possible.</p>

<p>Accustom yourself as much as possible to strike with one
hand, as it is much more graceful, and many players allow no
other blow.</p>

<p>The ladies will very much oblige all their associates in croquet
by avoiding long dresses, which are continually dragging
the balls about over the ground greatly to the annoyance of
the players and disturbance of the game.</p>

<p>To the gentlemen we would say it is no proof of skill in
executing the croquet, to swing your mallet with both hands,
and give a blow hard enough to kill an ox. If you want to
do that sort of thing&mdash;it would be more agreeable to all concerned
for you to go off alone somewhere and split wood.
An easy skillful stroke will send a ball anywhere within the
bounds, and a ball out of bounds may be brought in, so
nothing is gained by “sledge hammering,” except injuring
the implements, irritating the players and delaying the game.</p>

<p>In executing the roquet-croquet the stroke may be varied
so as to produce three very different results. First, if it is
desirable to have the secondary ball go much further than
your own, strike a <i>sharp</i>, <i>quick</i> blow, proportioned in force to
the distance you wish your own ball to go, checking the force
the instant the mallet hits the ball. Secondly, if you wish to
send both balls along together strike a more sweeping blow,
(not a push) permitting the mallet to have its full swing.
The difference in these two blows is much more easily discovered
by the player than described with the pen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The third stroke may partake of the nature of either of the
above, but differs in the fact that the blow of the mallet is not
delivered in a line with the centers of the two balls, but partially
to one side of the rear ball, thus producing the splitting
stroke, i. e., sending the two balls in courses diverging from
each other. This is much the most difficult stroke of the
three.</p>

<p>In procuring a set of croquet materials be sure that you
know what you want, or else buy a set manufactured by some
recognized manufacturer. It may seem a very simple thing
to have a set of mallets, &amp;c., made from a description, but
having tried the experiment we can testify that to procure suitable
lumber&mdash;well seasoned, have mallets well shaped, the
handles serviceable and not bungling, the balls <i>perfectly round</i>,
the bridges well formed and proportioned&mdash;and the painting
brilliant and properly arranged is a very difficult matter. An
English author on this subject says, “It was our fortune (or
rather misfortune) when in the country last year to take
part in a game of Croquet played with home-made materials.
We only hope that it will never be our lot to play
with such things again. The mallets were so large they had
to be used as one would a scythe in mowing grass. The
heads, instead of tapering at the center, bore a great resemblance
to an ale barrel on a small scale, and were so
large that if one attempted to croquet, one was sure to hit
one’s own foot instead of the ball. These, by-the-by, were
any shape but round. They bobbed up and down when in
progress, and scarcely ever went in the direction which it
was intended for them to go.... Such was the unsatisfactory
result of the combined labors of the local carpenter
and blacksmith. We therefore earnestly recommend
our readers to eschew the use of home-made sets of Croquet
altogether.”</p>

<p>We endorse the foregoing statement, adding that responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
manufacturers in various parts of the country are now furnishing
excellent sets of implements at a cheaper rate than
individuals can get up equally good sets for themselves.
There is therefore no economy in using a home-made set.</p>

<p><i>Parlor Croquet</i> is a very good substitute for the Lawn
game, and may be enjoyed in a winter day or evening very
much as canned fruit or preserved flowers are enjoyed as excellent
and beautiful substitutes for the delicious fruits of autumn
and fragrant flowers of summer. But as the canned
fruit is insipid when used beside the fresh fruit of autumn, so
will the parlor game seem when attempted in the season of
the field sport. There are two kinds of Parlor Croquet&mdash;which
may be termed Carpet Croquet, and Table or Board
Croquet.</p>

<p>The Carpet Croquet is played exactly like the field game
and with similar materials except that they are usually smaller,
being reduced in size in the same proportion that the space
available in a room is smaller than the Lawn Croquet ground.
The same relative proportion in the size of materials should
be preserved as that given for the materials of the Lawn game&mdash;assuming
as a standard&mdash;a ball from 2¼ to 2½ inches in diameter.
There are several ingenious devices for fastening the
bridges to the floor or carpet. Each one of those which we
have seen have some objections; but those which are fastened
with tacks are the simplest and we consider them the
best.</p>

<p><i>The Board game</i> is played on a board of any convenient
size&mdash;say five feet long and three feet wide&mdash;covered with
baize or flannel, and surrounded by a ledge or thin strip projecting
above the top surface three-fourths of an inch.</p>

<p>The bridges and posts are set in this board in the same
manner that the larger bridges are set in the ground on the
lawn. The balls should be about one inch in diameter and
may be of glass&mdash;but box-wood or ivory are better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The size of the mallets should be in proportion to that of
the balls&mdash;with handles about eight inches long.</p>

<p>The method of play is the same as in Lawn Croquet, except
the croquet is executed by placing the finger instead of
the foot on the playing ball. The rules are the same, except
that, <i>first</i>, a player driving his ball off the board terminates
his tour of play by that stroke and the ball must be placed
immediately on the starting spot; <i>second</i>, making two or more
steps at one stroke does not entitle the player to the privilege
of taking position up to one or more mallet’s length.</p>

<p>The Board Croquet is the most popular for the reason that
it does not injure the furniture in any room, while the Carpet
Croquet, although more like the Lawn game, requires a large
room&mdash;well cleared&mdash;or there will soon be an action of Croquet
<i>vs.</i> furniture.</p>

obstacle in the ground or from another ball.</p>

<p>[Some writers define the Roquet as the contact of the playing
ball with another ball under such circumstances as to constitute
a point. This is merely a matter of choice regarding
the facility of defining the other operations of the game. We
consider that our definition renders the whole matter much the
most simple.]</p>

<p class="dc13">THE game of Base Ball is fast becoming with
Americans what Cricket has already become
with the English, a national game. The sport
is both graceful and invigorating, and requires
when properly played the possession
both of muscularity of body and strength of
nerve. The exercise attendant on this game
develops all the physical powers and calls
into action every muscle and sinew in the human
frame. There are few sights more exhilarating and captivating
than a well contested match game between evenly
matched clubs. Such a spectacle rarely fails to draw admiring
throngs, and to be considered a first class player is a distinction
of which any American youth may feel proud. As
our readers will find this subject fully treated in professional
works, we do not propose to enter into any lengthy description
of the origin or progress of the game of Base Ball. We
shall therefore simply state that this game was derived from
the old English game of Rounders, reduced to a system, and
governed by rules and regulations adopted by “The National
Association of Base Ball Players,” held in New York, December<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
13, 1865. These regulations for the convenience of
our readers we here insert.</p>

<p class="psh">RULES OF THE GAME.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 1. The ball must weigh not less than five and
one-half, nor more than five and three-fourths ounces avoirdupois.
It must measure not less than nine and one-half, nor
more than nine and three-fourths inches in circumference. It
must be composed of India rubber and yarn, and covered with
leather, and, in all match games, shall be furnished by the
challenging club, and become the property of the winning
club as a trophy of victory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 2. The bat must be round, and must not exceed two
and a half inches in diameter in the thickest part. It must
be made of wood, and may be of any length to suit the striker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 3. The bases must be four in number, placed at
equal distances from each other, and securely fastened upon
each corner of a square, whose sides are respectively thirty
yards. They must be so constructed as to be distinctly seen
by the umpire, and must cover a space equal to one square
foot of surface. The first, second, and third bases shall be
canvas bags, painted white, and filled with some soft material;
the home base and pitcher’s point to be each marked by a flat
circular iron plate, painted or enameled white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 4. The base from which the ball is struck shall be
designated the home base, and must be directly opposite to the
second base; the first base must always be that upon the right-hand,
and the third base that upon the left-hand side of the
striker, when occupying his position at the home base. And in
all match games, a line connecting the home and first base and
the home and third base, shall be marked by the use of chalk, or
other suitable material, so as to be distinctly seen by the umpire.</p>

<p>Many of our clubs have an iron quoit for the home base,
that is in direct violation of the rule which states that the
home base must be marked by “a <i>flat</i> circular iron plate.”
Those we allude to rise in the center, and the consequence is,
when a ball touches the base, it flies off at a tangent, instead
of rebounding as if it had touched the ground, as it would do
were it flat, as the rule prescribes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 5. The pitcher’s position shall be designated by two
lines, four yards in length, drawn at right angles to a line
from home to second base, having their centers upon that line
at two fixed iron plates, placed at points 15 and 16 1-3 yards
distant from the home base. The pitcher must stand within
the lines, and must deliver the ball as near as possible over
the center of the home base, and for the striker.</p>

<p>[It will be seen that the rule requires the ball to be pitched
as near as possible over the home base, <i>and for the striker</i>;
the pitcher, therefore, has no right to pitch the ball to the
catcher especially, as is often done when a player is on the
first base, and umpires should see that the rule is enforced.</p>

<p>This important change was made by the Convention of
1863. The object being to do away with the unfair style of
pitching that was in vogue during 1861, ’62, and ’63, during
which period those pitchers who failed in achieving the success
attained by the lamented Creighton, offset their want of skill
by trying to intimidate the batsmen by pitching the ball <i>at</i>
them instead of <i>for</i> them as the rules require.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 6. Should the pitcher repeatedly fail to deliver to
the striker fair balls for the apparent purpose of delaying the
game, or for any cause, the umpire, after warning him, shall
call one ball, and if the pitcher persists in such action, two
and three balls; when three balls shall have been called, the
striker shall take the first base; and should any base be occupied
at that time, each player occupying it or them shall take
one base without being put out.</p>

<p>[In warning the pitcher before calling balls on him, all that
is necessary is to call “ball to the bat;” and if two balls are
pitched unfairly after such warning, “one ball” should be
called, and if one unfair ball be delivered after that call, then
“two” and “three” balls should be promptly called. A
pitcher “repeatedly” fails if he fails twice in succession;
and he “persists” in his unfair delivery if he pitch one ball
after the first penalty has been imposed. In the first innings
of a game, a little more latitude is allowable, but afterwards
the rule should be strictly enforced to the very letter of the
law.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 7. The ball must be pitched, not jerked or thrown
to the bat; and whenever the pitcher moves with the apparent
purpose or pretension to deliver the ball, he shall so
deliver it, and must have neither foot in advance of the front
line or off the ground at the time of delivering the ball; and
if he fails in either of these particulars, then it shall be declared
a baulk.</p>

<p>[The pitcher makes a baulk when he either jerks a ball to
the bat, has either foot in advance of the line of his position,
or off the ground at the time of delivering the ball, or moves
with the apparent purpose of pitching, without delivering the
ball. The sentence “time of delivering the ball” has been
interpreted by the Committee on Rules and Regulations of the
National Association to mean, the period when the last movement
of the arm is made in delivering the ball; and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
if either foot of the pitcher be off the ground when
this movement is made&mdash;it being nearly simultaneous with the
ball’s leaving the hand of the pitcher&mdash;umpires must declare
a baulk without being appealed to.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 8. When a baulk is made by the pitcher, every
player running the bases is entitled to one base, without being
put out.</p>

<p>[The striker cannot take a base, on a baulk, as he is not
considered a “player running the bases” until he has made
the first base and ceased to be a striker.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 9. If a ball, from a stroke of the bat, <i>first touches
the ground</i>, <i>the person of a player</i>, <i>or any other object</i>, behind
the range of home and the first base, or home and the third
base, it shall be termed foul, and must be so declared by the
umpire, unasked. If the ball first touches the ground, either
upon, or in front of the range of those bases, it shall be considered
fair.</p>

<p>[Nothing is mentioned in Section 9 in reference to any ball
that is caught, either on the fly or first bound, after touching
the side of a building, a fence, or a tree. In such cases a
special rule is requisite before beginning a match.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 10. A player making the home base, shall be entitled
to score one run.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 11. If three balls are struck at, and missed, and the
last one is not caught, either flying or upon the first bound, it
shall be considered fair, and the striker must attempt to make
his run.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 12. The striker is out if a foul ball is caught, either
before touching the ground, or upon the first bound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 13. Or, if three balls are struck at and missed, and
the last is caught, either before touching the ground, or upon
the first bound.</p>

<p>[The bound-catch, in this instance&mdash;the ball striking the
ground back of the home base&mdash;is considered in the light of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
a foul ball, as far as the fly-game is concerned, and consequently
when the ball is caught on the bound, on the third
strike, the player must be given out, the same as he was last
year under the bound rule.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 14. Or, if a fair ball is struck, and the ball is caught
without having touched the ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 15. Or, if a fair ball is struck, and the ball is held
by an adversary on first base, before the striker touches that
base.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 16. Any player running the bases is out, if at any
time he is touched by the ball while in play in the hands of
an adversary, without some part of his person being on the
base.</p>

<p>[All that is requisite for a player to “hold his base,” according
to the meaning of the rule, is, for him to touch the base
bag, no matter whether the bag is in its position or not.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 17. No ace or base can be made upon a foul ball;
such a ball shall be considered dead, and not in play until it
shall first have been settled in the hands of the pitcher. In
such cases players running bases shall return to them, and
may be put out in so returning in the same manner as the
striker when running to the first base.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 18. No ace nor base can be made when a fair ball
has been caught without having touched the ground; such a
ball shall be considered alive and in play. In such case players
running bases shall return to them, and may be put out in
so returning, in the same manner as the striker when running
to first base; but players, when balls are so caught, may run
their bases immediately after the ball has been settled in the
hands of the player catching it.</p>

<p>[It will be seen by the above two Sections that a player
running a base on a foul ball must return to the base he has
left <i>and remain on it</i> until the ball has been fairly settled in
the hands of the pitcher. But in case of fly-catches, a player<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
running a base is only required to return and touch the base, after
which he can leave it at once and try and make the next base.
He must, however, touch the base <i>after</i> the ball has been caught.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 19. The striker must stand on a line drawn through
the center of the home base, not exceeding in length three feet
from either side thereof, and parallel with the line occupied
by the pitcher. He shall be considered the striker until he
has made the first base. Players must strike in regular rotation,
and, after the first innings is played, the turn commences
with the player who stands on the list next to the one who
lost the third hand.</p>

<p>[This rule should be strictly enforced by the umpire.] A
striker has no right to avail himself of the advantage derived
from standing back of the line of his position, thereby increasing
the distance between himself and the pitcher, and obtaining
a better opportunity of judging the ball. Besides
which, a poorly hit ball which would strike the ground in front
of the home base&mdash;if the batsman stood on the line of his
base&mdash;and lead to his being put out, is changed to a foul ball
by his standing back of his base, and he thereby escapes the
penalty of his poor batting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 20. Players must make their bases in the order of
striking; and when a fair ball is struck, and not caught flying,
the first base must be vacated, as also the second and third
bases, if they are occupied at the same time. Players may
be put out on any base, under these circumstances, in the same
manner as the striker when running to the first base.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 21. Players running bases must touch them; and,
so far as possible, keep upon the direct line between them;
and must touch them in the following order: first, second,
third, and home; and if returning must reverse this order;
and should any player run three feet out of this line, for the
purpose of avoiding the ball in the hands of an adversary, he
shall be declared out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>[A player failing to touch his base must be declared out&mdash;after
an appeal&mdash;unless he can return to the base before he is
touched.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 22. Any player, who shall intentionally prevent an
adversary from catching or fielding the ball, shall be declared
out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 23. If the player is prevented from making a base,
by the intentional obstruction of an adversary, he shall be entitled
to that base, and not be put out.</p>

<p>[These two latter sections are, of course, intended solely
for any willful or unnecessary obstruction. It is impossible that
a player, while in the act of fielding a swiftly sent ball, can
always be on the lookout as to where his adversary is running,
or that a player running the bases can always be equally
careful in regard to his preventing an adversary from getting
to his base. Some base players have a habit of pushing
players off their bases while in the act of receiving the ball.
Such unfair play should be punished by promptly inflicting
the above penalty.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 24. If an adversary stops the ball with his hat or
cap, or if a ball be stopped by any person not engaged in the
game, or <i>if it be taken from the hands of any one not engaged
in the game</i>, no player can be put out unless the ball
shall first have been settled in the hands of the pitcher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 25. If a ball, from the stroke of a bat, is held under
any other circumstances than as enumerated in Section 22,
and without having touched the ground more than once, the
striker is out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 26. If two hands are already out, no player running
home at the time the ball is struck, can make a <i>run to count
in the score of the game</i> if the striker is put out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 27. An innings must be concluded at the time the
third hand is put out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 28. The game should consist of nine innings to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
side, when, should the number of runs be equal, the play
shall be continued until a majority of runs, upon an equal
number of innings, shall be declared, which shall conclude
the game.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 29. In playing all matches, nine players from each
club shall constitute a full field, and they must have been
regular members of the club which they represent, and of no
other club, <i>either in or out of the National Association</i>, for
thirty days prior to the match. No change or substitution
shall be made after the game has been commenced, unless for
reason of illness or injury. Position of players and choice
of innings shall be determined by captains, previously appointed
for that purpose by the respective clubs.</p>

<p>[This rule of course excludes players belonging to Junior
clubs from taking part in Senior club matches, and likewise excludes
players belonging to any base ball club, but not cricket
clubs, as cricket is a distinct game of ball.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 30. The umpire shall take care that the regulations
respecting the ball, bats, bases, and the pitcher’s and striker’s
position, are strictly observed. He shall be the judge of fair
and unfair play, and shall determine all disputes and differences
which may occur during the game; he shall take
special care to declare all foul balls and baulks immediately
upon their occurrence, unasked, in a distinct and audible
manner. He shall, in every instance, before leaving the
ground, declare the winning club, and shall record his decision
in the books of the scorers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 31. In all matches the umpire shall be selected by
the captains of the respective sides, and shall perform all the
duties enumerated in Section 30, except recording the game,
which shall be done by two scorers, one of whom shall be appointed
by each of the contending clubs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 32. No person engaged in a match, either as umpire,
scorer, or player, shall be either directly or indirectly interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in any bet upon the game. Neither umpire, scorer,
nor player shall be changed during a match, unless with the
consent of both parties (except for a violation of this law)
except as provided in Section 29, and then the umpire may
dismiss any transgressors.</p>

<p>[This rule was almost entirely ignored last season; for
there was scarcely a game played in which some one or other
of the parties abovenamed did not bet on the result. This
year more care will be taken to observe the rule; for those
who bet large sums on the leading contests of the season, intend
to dispute the loss of their bets in all cases wherein this
rule is not observed; and they will have the right&mdash;according
to the best sporting authority&mdash;to hold the stake-holder responsible
in every instance in which he pays over the stakes to
the winner when this rule has been broken; for under such
circumstances the wager is not fairly won, unless those who
bet mutually agree beforehand to allow of such infringement
of the rules of the game.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 33. The umpire in any match shall determine when
play shall be suspended; and if the game cannot be concluded,
it shall be decided by the last even innings, provided
five innings have been played, and the party having the
greatest number of runs shall be declared the winner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 34. Clubs may adopt such rules respecting balls
knocked beyond or outside of the bounds of the field, as the
circumstances of the ground may demand; and these rules
shall govern all matches played upon the ground, provided,
that they are distinctly made known to every player and umpire,
previous to the commencement of the game.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 35. No person shall be permitted to approach or to
speak with the umpire, scorers, or players, or in any manner
to interrupt or interfere during the progress of the game, unless
by special request of the umpire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 36. No person shall be permitted to act as umpire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
or scorer in any match, unless he shall be a member of a Base-Ball
Club governed by these rules.</p>

<p>This rule has never been properly observed. Every club
should appoint a regular scorer for the season, and he should
be competent to record the fielding as well as batting score of
the game. Until this is done a full analysis of the season’s
play of a club can not be obtained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 37. Whenever a match shall have been determined
upon between two clubs, play shall be called at the exact
hour appointed; and should either party fail to produce their
players within fifteen minutes thereafter, the party so failing
shall admit a defeat.</p>

<p>[This rule has always been a dead letter. When clubs
appoint a time for calling the game, it should be promptly
proceeded with after the time allowed by the rule has expired.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 38. Any match game played by any club in contravention
of the rules adopted by this Association, shall be
considered null and void, and shall not be counted in the list
of match games won or lost, except a game be delayed by
rain beyond the time appointed to commence the same. Any
match game can be put off by mutual consent of the parties
about engaging in the game. No match game shall be commenced
in the rain.</p>

<p>[This is a new rule and was designed to obviate the difficulty
attending upon the repudiation of any rule of the game
any two clubs may mutually agree to ignore. Thus, for instance,
any two clubs agreeing to allow a member of either
club to play in a match who has not been a member for thirty
days previous to a match, by this rule cannot claim the ball
won, or count the match played as a regular game. The exception
made in case of rain refers to that rule which requires
a game to be commenced within fifteen minutes of the time
appointed.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 39. No person who shall be in arrears to any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
club, or who shall at any time receive compensation for his
services as player, shall be competent to play in any match.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 40. Should a striker stand at the bat without striking
at good balls repeatedly pitched to him, for the apparent
purpose of delaying the game, or of giving advantage to a
player, the umpire, after warning him, shall call one strike,
and if he persists in such action, two and three strikes.
When three strikes are called he shall be subject to the same
rules as if he had struck at three fair balls.</p>

<p>[Section 40 is a rule that should be strictly enforced, as it
refers to a part of the game that is oft-times a very tedious
and annoying feature. How often do we see the striker, the
moment his predecessor has made his first base, stand still at
the home base and await the moment when the player on the
first base can avail himself of the failure of either the pitcher
or catcher to hold the ball while tossing it backward and forward
to each other. Some catchers&mdash;chiefly among boys,
however&mdash;actually stand to the right of the home base purposely
for this style of game; and even when the pitcher and
catcher are inclined to do their duty, the batsman is not, and
the latter is frequently allowed to stop the progress of the
game by his refusal to strike at good balls, under the plea
that they do not suit him, when it is apparent to all that he
simply wants to allow his partner to get to his second base.
In every respect it is preferable to play the game manfully,
and without resorting to any such trickery as this, which not
only tires the spectator, but detracts from the merit of the
game itself. Even under the new rule of pitching this unfair
play was practiced last season. It is to be hoped that umpires
will do their duty this year, and put an entire stop to
it, which they have the power to do.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 41. Every match hereafter made shall be decided by
the best two games out of three, unless a single game shall
be mutually agreed upon by the contesting clubs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>


<p class="psh p2">ON THE SELECTION AND MEASURING
OF A GROUND.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is of the greatest importance that a Base Ball ground
should be perfectly level and as free as possible from all obstructions
in the shape of irregularities, stones, &amp;c., and a
fine, short turf will be found to add materially to the comfort
of the players. The length of the field should be 600 feet,
while the breadth about 400. The home base or batter’s
stand, should be 70 feet from the head of the field. The
space between the home base and the catcher’s stand, must
be firmly packed earth as hard and level as a billiard table.
The bases should be square blocks of wood covered with a
double thickness of canvas and they are sometimes stuffed
with hair to prevent accidents from falling, and here let us
suggest that one point be not overlooked in preparing the
ground, that is the erection of seats protected by an awning,
for the accommodation of the “fair sex,” who manifest great
interest in this game, and whose presence never fails to inspire
the players with renewed ardor.</p>

<p>The bases should be firmly secured by leathern straps passing
completely around them. The simplest method of laying
out your ground is to first determine the point of your home
base. Then measure down the field 127 feet 4 inches, which
will give the position of your second base. Then taking a
cord 180 feet in length and fastening either end to the second
and home bases, by grasping the center and extending it to the
right and left you have the points of your first and third
bases. You have now found a square whose sides are 90 feet.
Then draw a line from the home to second base, and at a
point 45 feet from the former will be the pitcher’s first point,
and three feet further on the same line his second point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Posts painted white, and elevated from the ground so as to
be distinctly seen by the umpire, are placed on a line with the
home and first base, and home and third base, at least 100
feet from the bases. These are termed “foul ball posts,”
and are used by the umpire in his decisions in reference to
foul balls.</p>

<p class="psh">ON THE USE OF THE BAT.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> bats and balls used are made regulation size, and the
bats of different woods as may suit the striker. For a light bat
the English willow is prized by many, as its tough, close
fibre recommends it to the heavy batter, as well as the ease
with which it can be wielded. With those who prefer a
heavier bat the ash and hickory are favorites. A light bat is
generally preferred to a heavier one as it meets a swiftly
pitched ball with greater promptness. There are nearly as
many different modes of handling the bat as there are players.
We see some grasping it with the left hand on the handle, and
sliding the right swiftly down the bat. Others take the bat
near the middle, others swing it with a long sweeping stroke,
while still another class hold it as in Cricket, pointing to the
ground.</p>

<p>It is not so necessary to strike a powerful blow as to hit
with quickness, and at the same time maintain a firm and
natural position. It is not the heaviest, who make the most
powerful batters. Stand with the foot on the line of the
striker’s position, and be prepared to strike as soon as the
ball leaves the pitcher’s hand.</p>

<p class="psh">DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> order to play the game of Base Ball, nine players of a
side are necessary, one side taking the bat and the other
the field. Their relative positions are generally determined
by tossing a coin. A full game consists of nine innings to
each side, an inning lasting until three players are “put out,”
either at the bat or while running the bases, as will be seen
by referring to the rules. The side scoring the largest number
of runs during the game is declared victorious. The list
of fielders comprise catcher, pitcher, first, second and third
basemen, short stop, right, center and left fieldsmen. When
each one is in his appointed place, the captain of the fielding
nine calls out “ready,” to which the umpire promptly responds
“play!”&mdash;and upon the first ball which leaves the
pitcher’s hand the game commences.</p>

<p>The batsman or striker stands at the home base on a line
drawn through its center, parallel to one extending from first
to third base and extending three feet on each side of it. The
batsman requires considerable judgment to assist him in effectually
striking at balls. He must have a quick eye and
ready hand to meet the deceptive pitching of an experienced
player. If these qualities are wanting he may find himself
suddenly caught out on a “foul tip,” or forced ingloriously
to retire on a “three strike.” As soon as the ball is struck,
it is the duty of a batsman to run at once for the first base,
and should he arrive there before the ball reaches the baseman
he is said to have “made his base.” Many players acquire
the habit of pausing to watch the course of a ball which
may possibly fall within the “foul lines,” or if an “air ball”
be struck, waiting to see if it is caught by a fielder, before
he starts for his base. This is wrong, as if it prove a “foul,”
the umpire will announce it in time for the player to return,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and should the “fly ball” be missed or “muffed,” the player
is well on his way to the base. Upon reaching his base, the
striker is succeeded by the next batsman on the list, and
when three of these are “put out,” the fielders take their
turn at the bat. A run is scored by a player touching in succession
the four bases, avoiding being himself touched by the
ball while running. A home run is made by his hitting the
ball to such a distance that he makes the four bases before it
is returned. In case of a tie at the close of the ninth inning
the game may be prolonged until one or the other of the contestants
obtain the most runs on even innings.</p>

<p>Should anything occur to put a stop to the game, before
five innings have been played by each side the game is declared
drawn. For all other necessary particulars in regard
to the game, the reader is referred to the preceding rules and
regulations.</p>

</div>

<p class="psh">FIELD POSITIONS.</p>

<p class="psh p2 font1">1. The Catcher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> duty of this player is to catch or stop all balls pitched
or thrown to the home base. To fill this position properly,
requires no small measure of dexterity and skill, always on
the alert to secure foul bounds and tips, with a vigilant eye
to the bases, together with precision and power in throwing
to them, the catcher’s position is so important that he is generally
chosen captain of the nine.</p>

<p>After a striker has made his first base, the catcher should
advance toward the pitcher and stand directly behind the bat
so as to take the balls before they bound and by throwing
swiftly at the second base cut off a player from making that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
base. When a ball is batted high to long field and several
fielders run to catch it, he should distinctly call the fielder by
name whom he thinks surest to take it, when the others should
pause, and strive only to take it on the bound, should it be
missed on the fly.</p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh p2 font1">2. The Pitcher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> position of the player is behind a line four yards in
length, drawn at right angles from the home to second base,
at a distance of 45 feet from the former base. Four feet
in the rear of this line, in another parallel to it and in the
space between these two must the pitcher stand, immediately
before, and while delivering the ball. Both feet must be
firmly planted on the ground while he is pitching, and he
should be careful not to jerk or throw the ball, but deliver it
directly over the home base and for the striker. The pitcher
is frequently called upon to supply the places of basemen
while they are fielding, and it is of great importance that he
should be a ready catcher and good fielder. A ball pitched
at a high rate of speed, and at the same time containing a
bias or “twist” will prove the most effective. As this position
calls for a great amount of physical labor, some person
who is not easily fatigued should be selected to fill it.</p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh p2 font1">3. The Short Stop.</p>

<p>The duties of this player are many and arduous, and his
position the most dangerous one on the field. He stands in
the center of the triangle formed by the second and third
bases and pitcher’s position, though he should vary his position
according to his knowledge of different player’s style of
batting. It is to this spot that nearly all the swiftly batted
ground balls come, which require more nerve and practice to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
stop than any other. Upon securing the ball the short stop
should pass it swiftly to whatever base a player may be running
for, generally to the first. He should be on the alert to
cover the third base when the catcher throws to it; to back
up the second when receiving a ball from the fielders, and
also to take balls on the bound when missed by the third baseman
or pitcher.</p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh p2 font1">4. First Base.</p>

<p>This player should be a splendid catch, and able to hold
swiftly sent balls, as he will be obliged to take them from the
pitcher and short stop, more frequently than any of the other
basemen. He should play a little below his base, and inside
the line of the foul ball post in order to secure balls which
would otherwise pass him. As soon as the ball is struck he
should return to his base and with one foot upon it stand ready
to receive the ball from whatever player may have fielded it.</p>

<p>This is the only base where a player can be put out without
being touched by the ball, (excepting balls caught on
the fly, or those that are fouled) as it is only necessary that
the baseman with ball in hand touch the base before the striker
reaches it. He should instantly deliver the ball to the pitcher
or to any base where it may be necessary.</p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh p2 font1">5. Second Base.</p>

<p>Many ball players consider this position to be the most important
point in the whole game, and with good reason. It
should never be filled but by an accurate thrower, a sure
catcher and a thorough fielder. As most of the balls pass to
the left of this base it is well to play in that direction and a
little back of it, although when a player reaches the first base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the baseman should instantly return. The second base can
give material aid to the pitcher by backing him up closely,
and not suffering a ball to pass them both if possible to stop
it. If he fails to catch a ball, let him by all means stop it
in some way, in order to put out a player by touching him,
then return it to the pitcher.</p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh p2 font1">6. Third Base.</p>

<p>The position of third baseman is quite as important as any
of the others, as in this direction pass the majority of foul
balls, which with dexterity may be taken on the fly. As he
has considerable fielding to perform it is best that he play
away from his base, except when a player runs either to or
from it. He should never attempt to hinder a player from
reaching his base, and this advice should be taken and acted
upon by all basemen.</p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh p2 font1">7. Left Field.</p>

<p>Here is a chance for the display of the finest of fielding, as
half of the air balls are sent in this direction. The left fielder
is required to be a swift runner, powerful thrower, and an excellent
catcher in order to acceptably fill this position.</p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh p2 font1">8. Center Field.</p>

<p>This player should be in readiness to back up the second
base, and should never go to long field except when a heavy
hitter is at the bat. He is required to possess nearly the
same qualities which distinguish the left fielder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh p2 font1">9. Right Field.</p>

<p>It is difficult to find a poor place in any of the nine positions
in a well contested game of Base Ball, but if there is
one which is at all inferior to the rest, the right field should
be so considered, simply because balls are sent in this direction
but occasionally. Yet it is important that this field be
occupied by one who understands his business, as the batsman
if he sees signs of weakness there, will soon take advantage
of his discovery by batting frequently into that quarter.</p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh p2 font1">The Umpire.</p>

<p>One of the most undesirable positions on a Base Ball field
is that of the umpire. He cannot fail to displease some one
by his decisions, though he govern himself by the strictest
rules of the game. Great firmness here is necessary in supporting
a decision, and on any doubtful point it is better that
he adhere to his first impressions as they are most likely to
prove correct. No one should be allowed to approach, or
converse with the umpire during a game. He should close
both eyes and ears to everything outside of the game in progression,
and allow no remarks of whatever nature in reference
to his judgment to influence him in the least. All foul balls
should be called in a loud, clear and distinct tone of voice,
and no member of a club should question any decision, however
incorrect it may appear to them, but cheerfully acquiesce,
and if corrections are to be made, there will be plenty of
time at the conclusion of the game. It is unnecessary to add
that the person acting as umpire should possess a thorough
knowledge of the game in all its details. He must keep a
strict watch upon both pitcher and striker, and if necessary
call strikes or balls upon them in accordance with the rules.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
His position is to the right of and between the striker and
catcher, on a line between the home and third base.</p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh p2 font1">The Scorer.</p>

<p>The scorer may be regarded as the clerk of the game, and it
is his duty to record the score of each player, and make a full
and complete showing of each man’s standing throughout the
game. The same person should always be appointed scorer
in all match games, and he should be selected as well for his
gentlemanly qualities as for his familiarity with the game.</p>

</div>
<p class="dc14">ARCHERY was formerly one of the chief
pastimes of England, and at different periods
in modern days it has been a fashionable
amusement; and in this country
it has been practiced in some few localities.
Archery is a healthful and agreeable pastime,
and ought to be revived and in general
use all over this country; it is scarcely
excelled by any recreation in which propriety
permits young ladies to indulge.</p>

<p>The attitude of an <i>accomplished</i> female archer (for archery
is not to be acquired without much practice) at the moment
of bending the bow is particularly graceful; all the actions
and positions tend at once to produce a proper degree of
strength in the limbs and to impart a general elegance of
bearing.</p>

<p>Ladies usually shoot at a distance of about fifty yards.
Two targets are placed opposite each other, and the archers
shoot from one to the other; that is, when all the party have
shot at one target, they walk up to it, gather their arrows,
and shoot back to the one they came from, to which they
again return when their arrows are expended; and so on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
shooting from one to the other in rotation. In that way not
merely the arm, but the whole frame, enjoys the benefit of
salutary exercise in the open air, while the mind is interested
and the spirits elevated by the sport.</p>

<p>The attitude in shooting is a matter of much importance;
the feet should be a few inches apart, the neck slightly curved,
so as to bring the head a little downward; the face, but no
part of the front of the body, is to be turned towards the
mark. The left arm must be held out quite straight to the
wrist, which should be bent inwards; the bow is to be held
easy in the hand; and the arrow, when drawn, should be
brought, not towards the eye, but the ear. The right hand
should begin to draw the string as the left raises the bow;
when the arrow is three parts drawn, the aim is to be taken.
In doing this the head of the arrow should appear to the right
of the mark; the arrow is then drawn to its head, and immediately
loosened.</p>

<p>To draw the arrow from the mark or ground it should be
taken by the hand, as near the head of the arrow as possible,
and extracted in the same direction as it entered. If these
instructions be not attended to, the young archer will break
many arrows in drawing them from the ground, or the mark,
when she is so successful as to hit it.</p>

<p>In selecting a bow the chief point to be attended to is the
adaptation of the bow to the strength of the person who is to
use it. Bows, arrows, and accoutrements can easily be obtained
in any city. Any boy can find good material for bows
in almost any piece of woods, and easily make a bow for himself
or his lady friends.</p>

<p>Targets are made of wood and generally painted in circles.
The central point is the one to be aimed at by the archers.</p>

<p>The same dresses used at Croquet parties are desirable for
Archery, and add much to the graceful appearance of the
Archer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us become skillful Archers and have Archery meetings
as of old, and let ladies and gentlemen, or boys and girls, contend
for the prizes.</p>

<p>It is useless here to give an elaborate essay on the history
of Archery; any person sufficiently enthusiastic to desire it,
can easily obtain English books containing detailed directions
on Archery, and its history from ancient to modern times.</p>

<p class="dc14">WE, as a nation, are not a happy, home-loving
people. The “spirit of unrest”
pervades all classes.</p>

<p>This enterprising, uneasy spirit, has
been, and is, of benefit to us as a comparatively
new country, in settling and
breaking our wild Western lands.</p>

<p>But the time has come, when it is well
to curb that spirit, and cultivate all quiet,
home-loving influences.</p>

<p>Therefore, I beseech you, parents, to begin in earliest infancy,
to cultivate a love of the beautiful in nature, give
your little ones flowers; and as soon as they are able to play
in the garden, give them a little spot of their own to dig in;
and when they can understand the process, give them seeds to
plant, and some few flowers to cultivate. I can tell you of a
happy cottage home, where the children, from earliest infancy,
have lived among flowers. Each had their tiny garden, with
spade, hoe, trowel and watering-pot. The father and mother
would also assist with their own hands in training vines, roses
and shrubs, in artistic beauty. The good father never went
to his counting-room without some flowers in his hand, or in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the button-hole of his coat, the valued gift from the tiny garden
of one of his darlings. Years passed and fortune favored
them, but they never would exchange their cottage home, with
its vines, trees and shrubs, for all the stately mansions in the
town. And as the daughters married, and the sons left to
seek their fortunes, they would look back with intense longing
to their loved home; and joyous were their meetings around
the home Christmas tree.</p>

<p>On Sundays they always, even in midwinter, ornamented
their social table with flowers, for they are God’s smiles.
Therefore, my friends, I speak from observation, and from
seeing the effect of an opposite course. If you wish to lessen
your doctor’s bill, and give the beauty of robust health and
happiness to your children, girls or boys, give them a garden
and let them plant, weed and water it. If your children
bring you even a simple field daisy, express your pleasure to
them, and let them not see you cast it aside.</p>

<p>Teach your boys the use of a pruning-knife, and how to
graft; then give them some trees to experiment upon. You
may save them from dissipation, by giving them a taste for
Horticulture. It is a happy, health-giving employment.</p>

<p>Decorate even your barn with graceful vines. The poorest
house can be made an agreeable place, by transplanting a few
of the many simple, wild vines. It is not natural to love intensely
a stiff, ungainly object.</p>

<p>I have often thought, as I have roamed about the farming
districts of New England, and have seen the many great,
stiff, square houses, with not a graceful tree, or flower to relieve
their nakedness, (though now and then a syringa, or
lilac bush, or cinnamon rose, and perhaps a stately old butternut,
may be seen,) the sons and daughters of those households
will surely emigrate. Utility is our hobby. Some
farmers think it waste time to plant a flower, as it yields no
fruit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Remember the old saying, “all work and no play makes
Jack a dull boy.” You that dwell in a city, strive to have a
small spot in the country to which you may send your children
in Summer, to roam at will. I heard a little child, in urging
her mother to go into the country in vain, cry out, “It is too,
<i>too bad</i>, mamma, I know God did not make the city for little
children, because he loves us.”</p>

<p>Do not waste your money at fashionable watering-places.
Even in early years, take your children to the woods and let
them see nature in its wild state. There is nothing like a day
in the woods for refreshing us all, in body and mind. The
wild music of running brooks is so lulling, the birds carol
their “native wood-notes wild” so sweetly, the strange blended
odor of the damp mould, the leaves, the wild flowers, and the
prospect of the distant meadow, are so delightful; the play
of the sunlight through the dense foliage, and on the sylvan
walks, is so beautiful, and the quiet is so marked, after the
hum and roar of a city, that the mind is tranquilized, and
both you and your children will be nearer to God, and nearer
to one another, for every hour so spent. Our whole country
is full of wild beauty. Spend your spare money in decorating
your homes with trees, flowers and shrubs. The influence
upon your children will be far more beneficial.</p>

<p>If your children wish for money to purchase seeds and
flowers for their gardens, if possible, give it cheerfully. It
is far better so spent than in dress and toys. Let them plan
their own gardens and experiment as much as they please. A
very pretty fence can be made round such gardens, by a number
of stakes of equal lengths pointed at one end to drive
into the ground, square at the top, and painted green. Then
place them at equal distances around your garden, and bore
holes about six or seven inches apart for the twine, which
should be brown linen. Pass the twine through the holes, in
lines all around the garden. Plant vines which run rapidly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
such as Cypress Vine, Madeira Vine, Nasturtium, Maurandya
Barclayanna, Dwarf Convolvulus, Mountain Fringe, &amp;c., &amp;c.
By midsummer your simple fence will be very beautiful.</p>

<p>Having spent many years in cultivating flowers, perhaps a
few practical directions from my own experience may be of
service to my readers.</p>

<p class="psh">HOW TO PLANT SEEDS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> often think because the seed we plant does not germinate
that we have purchased poor seed, when the fault is in
the manner of planting.</p>

<p>Nearly all kinds of flower seeds require transplanting,
therefore it is best to plant in boxes, pots, or hot-beds. Old
cigar boxes are convenient and are easily handled, but first
bore holes in the bottom of the boxes, and in your pots or
boxes place either broken clam or oyster shells or pieces of old
flower pots as a drainage; then take light, rich earth and sift
it or rub it carefully in your hands to be sure there are no
lumps; some bake the earth to destroy any insects which may
be in it, but it answers the same purpose to pour boiling water
on it. After you have filled your boxes or pots with this
prepared earth, sprinkle your seed carefully over it, and sift
over them light soil sufficient to cover them, moisten them
with warm water, and place the box where there is but little
light and throw a piece of paper over the top. A warm place
will start them best. Let them remain thus several days, till
the seeds have a chance to swell, before you give them much
light, and keep the earth moist; (a sponge is excellent to
water them, as it does not disturb the position of the seeds;
also use warm water,) as soon as you see they are sprouting
give them light, and air, if not too cold, or else the plant will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
not have strength to grow well. Hot-beds are the best, and
can be made with but little expense, by taking some old box,
and if you do not possess an old window sash you can purchase
one of some builder for a trifling sum of money, and
fit it to your box by nailing strips at the sides; dig a place the
size of the box and two or three feet deep, fill it with horse
manure mixed with straw, which is the most heating, then
sprinkle soil over the top about six inches deep, place your
box on the top, carefully heaping the earth around the outside,
and your hot-bed is made, in which you can start your seeds
and slips by either placing your boxes or pots in the earth on
top of the manure and plant your seeds and slips in them, or
as many prefer, planting in the soil of your hot-bed. After
your seedling plants are of sufficient size to transplant, if you
first transplant them into small pots, you can easily plant them
in your flower beds without disturbing the roots, and the plants
will not require covering; you must first dig a hole and pour
water into it, then carefully slip the plant, dirt and all, from
the pots and place into the hole made for it and press the
earth tight around it. Of course they must remain in the pot
till they are well rooted. In raising slips you need to mix in
full half common scouring sand with the soil, and they must
be shaded from the light several days.</p>

<p>All who care for flowers will desire to raise Verbenas, as
they blossom all Summer. If you wish to raise them from
seed they should be sown in February or first of March.
One secret in raising fine Verbenas is change of soil. It
would be better to plant them every year in a different location,
but if you renew the soil it will do to plant them twice in
the same bed, but never three years in succession. Indeed,
flowers as well as vegetables need constant change of soil;
they soon exhaust the earth. Seeds are better that are raised
in locations distant from the place where they are to be sown.
Flowers soon deteriorate if you continue to plant over and over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
from seed raised in the same spot; that is one of the reasons
why seeds from Europe are generally preferred by florists.
Japan Pink seed should be planted in March, in order to
have them flower the first year; they are hardy and blossom
also the second year. Pansy seed should be planted as early
as Verbenas. Ten Weeks’ Stock, Phlox Drummondi, Double
Zinnias, Lobelia, Petunias, Portulaca, Salpiglossis, Candytuft,
Larkspur, &amp;c., should be planted in April. If you desire
to raise Picotee or Carnation Pinks for the next year, and
Canterbury Bells and Fox Gloves, sow in April. Sow Asters
of all kinds the last of April or first of May. Some of the
climbers, such as Maurandya, Barclayanna, Tropæolum, commonly
called Nasturtium, Cypress Vine, Thunbergia, &amp;c., need
transplanting, and better be sown early. Sweet Peas should
be sown in the open soil about three inches deep, early in
April. It is better to soak the seed in warm water before
sowing. When they have germinated and as they begin to
climb, fill in earth around them, and water now and then
thoroughly with soap suds. Mignonette should not be transplanted;
sow the seed in the open soil the first of May.
Candytuft and Sweet Alyssum, are hardy, and the seed can
be sown out of doors; but if you have once had them, they
will come up self sown; look over your beds in Spring and
take up such plants, when you have the soil prepared and
beds made, then you can plant them back again where you
desire. Joseph’s Coat is a very brilliant plant, its leaves are
all shades of green, red and yellow; the seed can be sown
either in or out of doors by the first of May, also Golden Calliopsis.
Balsams will grow better if the seeds are not planted
till the second week in May out of doors.</p>

<p>All the flowers I have mentioned are desirable even in a
small garden; of course there are hundreds of varieties of
even annuals, but unless you have a gardener it is impossible
to raise them all, for it is desirable even in a small garden to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
have some flowers raised by slips, or bought from some greenhouse,
such as Fuchsias, Double Feverfews, Scarlet Geraniums,
Heliotropes, Rose Geraniums, Lemon Verbenas, Monthly
Roses and Hardy Perpetuals, &amp;c. Hardy Perpetual Roses
are desirable in every garden, they grow so thrifty and blossom
all summer, and with a little covering will live out all
Winter; and if they are showered often early in the Spring
while the dew is on the roses, with whale oil soap suds, using
a syringe to shower them, it will prevent the usual damage
done by the slug. If you have a shady, moist place in your
garden there you can plant your Lily of the Valley, double
blue English Violet, Forget-me-not, and Pansy.</p>

<p>Fuchsias also require some shade. Heliotropes and Geraniums
will bear enriching more than most plants; often watering
with guano water is excellent. A table-spoonful of guano
to a common water-pail full of water is sufficiently strong. It
also improves Pansies, Fuchsias and nearly all plants except
Roses. Soap suds is better for Roses and Verbenas, at least
according to my experience. Nearly all plants make a finer
show in a garden arranged either in beds, each variety by itself,
or in clusters. Before planting your garden in Spring
it is well to carefully consider the nature of each flower, and
arrange your garden so that each flower can be displayed to
advantage; never plant promiscuously; it is astonishing what
a difference landscape gardening will make in the general
aspect of even a small place. It is quite as desirable as to
arrange the colors in a picture to harmonize. Even an old
stump of a tree can be made beautiful by planting vines
around it, or by scooping out the top and filling in soil, and
planting Nierembergia, Lobelia, Double Nasturtium, Variegated
Myrtle, &amp;c., in it. Those I have mentioned blossom all
Summer, except the Myrtle, the leaves of which are as beautiful
as many flowers.</p>

<p>If we ladies would spend less time on our dress and in arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
for the table, and take that time for working in
our gardens with our children, we should not only make our
homes more attractive but we should gain in health and
strength. Early every Spring call a family council to decide
the arrangement of your flower garden. Let your boys have
a place to raise vegetables as a pastime. Encourage them to
diligence by promising to purchase all they will raise; in
that way they can earn money to give to the poor, or for their
Christmas presents; even children will take far more pleasure
in giving what they have really earned with their own hands.</p>

<p class="psh">FERNERIES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Is</span> it not, my friends, very pleasant to have a bit of the
Summer woods in our parlors in midwinter? Such a pleasure
is within the reach of us all, with but little trouble and
expense. Those who live in cities and cannot go into the
country, surely must have some friend who can supply them,
or the materials can be obtained at any public greenhouse.
First you require a glass dome, or what is still better, take
five panes of glass any size you please, four to form the sides,
one for the top, fasten the glass together with a light wooden
frame, then take any tin dish, like a baking pan, or if round
a tin plate or jelly cake pan, or a tin dish can be made to fit
it for a trifling sum of money; paint the tin green on the
outside. Then collect some pieces of broken flower pots, or
still better, bits of marble, granite or any stone and scatter
them around the tin dish, placing in the center some moss-grown
stump or stick, and pile the stones around it; then collect
from the woods, ferns, mosses, partridge-vines with its
bright red berries, (indeed, any plant will grow in these ferneries
which can be found in moist places in the woods;) take up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a little of the leaf mould in which they grow, they need but
little soil, arrange your plants spreading the roots carefully
over the stones, scattering a little leaf mould on them, and
placing your mosses around the whole. The tallest plants
should form the center, but in arranging even ferneries, it is
more agreeable to exercise your own taste. Before placing
your globe or glass frame over your fernery, sprinkle the
plants thoroughly, then cover with the glass, and let it remain
a few days in the shade. You can keep them where
you please, but I think they grow better near a window; be
very careful not to water them too often, once a month is generally
sufficient; if too wet they will mould and die; when
there is but little moisture on the glass, it is well to raise the
glass to ascertain if it is dry. My fernery has been made four
years, it has required but little care; now and then I add a
new fern, some moss, or any suitable plant gathered from the
woods, and remove any dried ferns or leaves. It often renews
itself. Trailing arbutus and partridge-vines will blossom
in ferneries. It is always pleasant to the eye and no care after
the first expense and trouble. Ivy and Lycopodium grow
well in ferneries, but the rare ferns, &amp;c., from green-houses do
not flourish as well as those plants taken from our native woods.</p>

<p class="psh">IVIES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">English Ivies</span> are a great ornament to our rooms, and
are hardy and require very little care. After the first two
years they grow quite rapidly, therefore it is well to procure
two year old plants, train them on your curtains, over your
windows and pictures. Many make a mistake by changing
the pots very often, thinking they require a very large pot,
which is not so, for they do not require as much earth as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
many plants, only keep them moist, and have rich loam for
the soil; it is well to water them every month with guano
water, prepared according to the same rule given for flowers.
The poet’s ivy is very pretty, the leaf being quite small. The
most beautiful ivy I ever saw was one that never was removed
from its place Summer or Winter; it filled a large bay window,
encircled the whole room and wound around many
pictures; now and then a gardener came and changed the soil,
and the leaves were occasionally washed. Hanging baskets
of moss with flowers growing in it, are exceedingly pretty in
Winter.</p>

<p class="psh">PRESSED FLOWERS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> press flowers, to be arranged on paper like a painting, you
must take some plain white wrapping paper, (in Paris you
can obtain paper prepared by a chemical process to preserve
the colors) and place your flowers or leaves carefully between
two sheets of the paper. Then press them by placing a heavy
weight over them, (letter presses are excellent) and leave
them a day or two, then change the paper; thus the juices of
the flowers are absorbed. It takes a week or two to press
perfectly, and in Summer often longer. When dry, place
them in a book or some air-tight box ready for use. A year
is required to make a varied and handsome collection, as each
flower has its own season for blossoming. Wild flowers retain
their colors better than cultivated; but experience alone
will teach you what flowers will retain their color best. Many
pretend to be able to preserve all kinds of flowers, but it is impossible.
I will give a list of flowers which are known to retain
their color by this mode of pressing.</p>

<p>All Geraniums (except the horse-shoe and sweet-scented),
preserve their color. They are very essential, as their colors
are brilliant and keep for years. All yellow flowers both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
wild and cultivated retain their color. The Violet and Pansy,
Dwarf Blue Convolvulus, Blue Larkspur, Blue Myrtle, Blue
Lobelia, Heaths, the small original Red Fuchsia, Wild Housatonia,
and many tiny blue, and even white flowers press perfectly.</p>

<p>For green, Ivy, Maiden Hair, Ferns or Brake, Mosses, &amp;c.,
retain their color best. Rarely a cultivated green leaf presses
well. Autumn leaves, if small, and the youngest oak leaves
mix in well. Certain kinds of stems such as Pansy, and others
of similar character, are best adapted for pressing.</p>

<p>After your collection is made, take some card-board, without
a polish if possible, and arrange your flowers as you design
to have them. Gum them to the paper with tragacanth,
using a camel’s hair brush, then press on the paper and flower
with a cloth, carefully absorbing all moisture, as well as firmly
pressing the flower on the paper. Geraniums and some large
flowers look better if each leaf is glued on separately.</p>

<p>In forming your bouquet, it is better to arrange the stems
first and work upwards. Baskets and vases of moss with
flowers are pretty. To form these, you must trace out with a
pencil your vase or basket, and glue on the moss. Then arrange
your flowers.</p>

<p>I have heard amusing criticisms on the coloring of such bouquets,
from persons who mistook them for paintings. Framed
and covered with a glass, they make ornamental pictures.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant way of preserving mementos of friends,
places or events. Flower albums or journals are very beautiful.
Wreaths arranged of different varieties of Pelargoniums
mixed in with any pretty green, and other little flowers, such
as Lobelias, are very handsome and the colors are durable.
Pansies of different shades look well, and brilliant wreaths
may be made of all the varieties of flowers that hold their
color. The oval shape looks the best for wreaths.</p>

<p>There are innumerable varieties of Ferns, Lycopodiums and
Maiden Hair, both native and foreign, suitable for pressing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
By pasting each specimen on a separate sheet and interspersing
specimens of our beautiful Autumn leaves also on separate
sheets, and fastening them together, either bound as a
book or in a portfolio, you will possess a beautiful and attractive
book with but little expense.</p>

<p>Crosses can be arranged with ferns and shaded to appear
as if painted in perspective, and look like a cross standing on
a mossy bank, with flowers, &amp;c., growing around and over it.
First draw and shade your cross as a guide, then take the
small leaflets of the darkest colored ferns you can procure,
and glue them on carefully where the cross should be in
shadow darkest, then take the brighter green ferns (such as
are gathered in Spring,) and end with the white ferns (which
can only be obtained in the Fall), using them for the lightest
shade; be careful to cover every part and shade it with nature’s
colors as you would with paint; in a cross six inches
high and suitably proportioned, full two hundred of the tiny
leaflets of the fern may be used to good advantage before it
is completed. Then take wild Lycopodium if you can obtain
it, if not, the finest of the cultivated, and arrange it on
your cross to look like a vine growing over and hanging from
it; also paste on to it tiny little pressed Lobelias, and arrange
small ferns, mosses and any little flowers (wild ones are
preferable), around the base of the cross to look like a mossy
bank. Different designs can be arranged in the same way.</p>

<p>Be very careful in pasting on flowers and leaves that every
part, however small, is firmly fixed to the paper; press them
on after pasting with a dry cloth.</p>

<p class="psh">STRAWBERRIES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> hints as regards the cultivation of Strawberries may
be useful to both boys and girls; for fine berries can be raised
even on a small plot of ground, if the soil be rich. Plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
for a new bed should be set out early in the Spring; the roots
will then grow strong and the plants will be better able to
bear the cold of Winter. Some gardeners prefer to plant
their strawberry roots in August, or even late in the Autumn,
and if the Winter is mild, or deep snows cover the ground,
the vines will live and bear fruit the next Summer. Some
prefer to raise strawberries in hills, but the most prolific vines
are those planted in beds about three feet wide with a path
between, filled with straw, to keep the fruit from the ground;
it is well to cut off most of the runners. Of course the beds
should be kept free from weeds. There are many new varieties,
but the old Hovey’s Seedling is as reliable as any and
very prolific. The Russell is easily propagated; vines planted
in April will often yield fine strawberries in June. The Wilson
is a profitable strawberry for the market because of its
large yield, but it is hardly equal in flavor to the Hovey.
The Hovey will soon run out if planted by itself; it requires
some other kind to be planted with it. The Pine is usually
the variety selected for that purpose. It is useless to enumerate
the several varieties, for nearly every locality has its
favorite strawberry. Some kinds will scarcely bear a perfect
berry in some locations, while in a different locality the same
berry will be loaded with perfect fruit. Sometimes a healthy
and vigorous looking bed of strawberry-plants will produce
but few berries&mdash;then you must examine the blossoms, those
which bear fruit will have the berry formed in the flower&mdash;while
others will blossom freely but do not bear fruit; these
are the male plants and it is better to leave but few of them
in your strawberry beds. When you plant the new roots dig
a hole with a trowel and fill it with water, then spread out
the roots and pack the earth close around them, but when
they are fully rooted and commence to grow, the earth should
be kept loose around them.</p>

<p>Strawberry plants should be replanted every third year; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
is best to change the location of the bed if possible, or at
least to renew the soil. Boys or girls who raise and gather
from their own little garden a dish of strawberries will find
great pleasure in presenting it to their friends as fruits of
their own labor.</p>

</div>

<p class="psh">GRAPES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> care of the grape-vine is a pleasant occupation. To
gather the rich, ripe bunches of its delicious fruit is a grand
enjoyment. Almost every one can command a spot of ground
sufficient for the liberal support of a grape-vine. It may be
planted in any unappropriated corner about the house&mdash;a
sunny spot is to be preferred, but a vine may do well with but
little direct sunshine, if it is well sheltered and properly cared
for. It may be planted at the foot of a tree, the branches of
which are not near the ground, and it will find its way high
up the tree and will yield large crops of fine fruit hidden
among its own thick foliage and that of the tree, provided the
ground immediately about its roots can be reached and kept
warm by the sun’s rays.</p>

<p>As it grows it will endeavor to adapt itself to the circumstances
that surround it, and will take the direction your taste
or convenience require it to follow. Its flexible branches are
obedient to the gentle hand of the careful cultivator. You may
train it upon stakes six or eight feet high, or upon a low trellis
where the fruit will be within easy reach of your hand. You
may have the fruit within a few inches of the ground, or by
removing all the lower branches of the vine, you can cause
the ripe bunches to hang in graceful festoons around and over
the window of your chamber, high above the reach of accident
and pilferers. The grape-vine will do as it is bid, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
is much more than can be said of some young people, whose
eyes sparkle at the sight of its fruit.</p>

<p>In preparing the ground in which to plant the vine, reference
must be had to the character of the soil. If the soil is
clayey and cold, or if the neighboring surface is such as to
turn an undue proportion of the rains upon the place where
you propose to plant your vine, care must be taken to secure
for the roots of the vine a sufficient drainage. If the roots
of the vine are surrounded by wet and cold earth, the fruit
will mature slowly and will be endangered by the early frosts.
You will secure a sufficient drainage by digging a hole three
feet deep and five or six feet in diameter and throwing into it
small stones, fragments of bricks or other like rubbish, to the
depth of about eighteen inches, and filling to the surface with
the soil. If the soil in which you propose to plant your vine
is light, no artificial drainage will be necessary.</p>

<p>Dig over the ground and mix with it some well rotted manure
or bone dust to the depth of your spade. The plan of
trenching and deep manuring is of questionable advantage.
The roots of the vine prefer to run near the surface, but they
will seek the rich soil wherever it may be; and if they are
drawn away from the surface of the ground and out of their
natural direction to the colder soil below, the effect upon the
fruit may be unfavorable, both as to quality and quantity.</p>

<p>In the ground thus prepared set your young vine from the
nursery. First, drive down a stake to which you can tie the
young vine, then place the roots of the vine three inches below
the surface of the ground, carefully spreading the roots
so that they will be as nearly as possible in the position in
which they grew in the nursery.</p>

<p>The beautiful operations of nature will then commence.
The roots of the vine will at once begin to adapt themselves
to their new home, and their delicate fibres will firmly clasp
the particles of the well-prepared soil; the warm days of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
early Spring will draw the sap up through the whole length
of the vine, the buds will open and exhibit their delicate tints,
new shoots and broad green leaves will follow, and you can
soon eat the fruit of your own labor, sitting beneath the shadow
of your own vine.</p>

<p class="psh">DESIGNS FOR FLOWERS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are many beautiful ways of arranging flowers, besides
in our costly vases. For example, take a basket and knit
like a garter pieces of different shades of moss colored worsted;
then dip in hot water and press them; when dry ravel nearly
out, only leaving an end which can be fastened on to the
basket with sewing silk or green glace thread and a large
needle. A basket tastefully covered in this way looks as if
it were made of moss, and it retains its beauty longer; a tin
dish should be made to fit it, and painted green; keep it filled
with natural flowers. I should prefer such an ornament to
costly porcelain. Many fill such baskets with exquisite French
flowers, which imitate nature perfectly.</p>

<p>To form a pyramid of flowers, take three, four or five
wooden bowls according to the size you wish for your pyramid,
let them be a regular gradation in size, procure some
round pieces of wood, like ribbon blocks, graded in size, glue
the tallest into the centre of the largest bowl so that it will
stand upright, and upon top of that glue the bowl next in
size, and so on to the smallest bowl. Varnish the inside several
coats; paint the outsides green and cover with moss;
some have a stand made and glued to the bottom of the
largest bowl. When filled with flowers, it is a lovely sight.
Baskets made of tin and painted green, then covered with
moss, make the prettiest hanging baskets possible. Tin rings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
large enough to surround vases placed inside, and made to
hold water, with little wires across the top and painted green,
when filled with flowers, form the prettiest mats in the world;
the wires keep the flowers in place. I saw one filled with only
small Rose-buds, blue Forget-me-nots and Geranium leaves.
It is an improvement to cover the outside with moss. Crosses
made in the same way are very beautiful and are appropriate
to place on the grave of any beloved friend. In that way
flowers can be preserved a long time, if there is a sufficient
supply of water to preserve them.</p>

<p>There are innumerable ways of arranging flowers. The
poorest person can afford to purchase a tin basin, and with
a little common paste and moss, which can be found in all
country places, a pretty dish for flowers is soon made.
Shells make lovely vases. The large shells sailors polish so
exquisitely to resemble mother-of-pearl, make elegant hanging
vases; bore holes on each side and hang them with strong
cords.</p>

<p>Decorate your rooms with flowers if possible. If you have
sick friends at home or abroad, carry them flowers; it will
cheer them more than you can realize unless you too have
been sick.</p>

<p class="psh">TO PRODUCE VARIOUS FLOWERS FROM
ONE STEM.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scoop</span> the pith from a small twig of elder; split it length-ways,
and fill each of the parts with seeds that produce different
colored flowers. Surround the seed with earth; tie the
two bits of wood together, and plant the whole in a pot filled
with earth. The stems of the different plants will thus be so
incorporated as to exhibit to the eye only one stem, throwing
out branches with the different flowers you have planted. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
choosing the seeds of plants which germinate at the same time,
and which are nearly similar in the texture of their stems, an
ingenious person may obtain artificial plants extremely curious.</p>

<p class="psh">TO PRESERVE ROSES TILL WINTER.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is pleasant to see the Summer flowers in midwinter, and
they who cannot have Roses blooming at that period within
doors can preserve them in Summer to decorate their table in
Winter. First select from your Rose-trees the most beautiful
specimens as they are just ready to blossom; tie a piece of
fine thread around the stalk of each; do not handle the bud,
or the stalk; cut it from the tree with the stalk two or three
inches in length; melt sealing-wax and quickly apply it to
the end of the stalk; the wax should only be just warm
enough to be ductile; form a piece of paper into a cone-like
shape, and place the Rose within it; twist it at the ends to
exclude the air; put it in a box, and put the box into a
drawer; this is to be sure that it is air-tight. In Winter take
it out, cut off the end of the stalk, place it in luke-warm water,
and in two or three hours it will become fresh and fragrant.
If the room is very warm it will answer to put it in
cold water.</p>

<p class="dc08">IN a practical treatise like the present, a dissertation
on the antiquities and history of Illumination
will not be looked for; nor is there space
for the amount of detail that would be necessary
to make the subject thoroughly understood.
The more knowledge, however, the student has
to work upon, the purer and more complete
must be his practice; knowledge gives decision,
decision leads to facility, and facility in any
art whatever, is the main object of pursuit.</p>

<p>For such knowledge, full, clear and accurate as it should
be, we must refer to long and learned treatises; and to the
inspection of many actual examples; since to understand
clearly what is meant by illumination, one should not only
read much, but study the work itself at every stage of its
career. To look into this matter thoroughly, reference should
be made to books upon illumination. Among the best of
these books are “The Art of Illumination,” by Wyatt, and
“Noel Humphrey’s Work.” However, a few directions may

purple madder, burnt carmine, Indian purple, emerald green,
green oxide of chromium, vandyke brown, lamp-black, Chinese
white.</p>

<p>These five lists will be found to be carefully selected, and
to contain the colors best adapted for illumination.</p>

<p>There is not space in this book to enter into the peculiarities
and properties of these colors, which are fully discussed
in several works and treatises. The colors here recommended
are permanent in character, but chrome yellows, red lead and
pure scarlet it is best to avoid, as they are not lasting. Pure
scarlet is fugitive and the others in time turn black. “Winsor
and Newton’s moist water colors” are the best for all
illuminating purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Good Bristol board with a fine firm grain, and having an
ivory-like surface, but without gloss, is the best material for
illuminating upon.</p>

</div>

<p class="psh">BRUSHES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Few</span> brushes are required for illumination, but from the
peculiar character of the work, and the nature of the colors,
&amp;c., employed, it is requisite that the right kinds should be
carefully selected. For general use, the red sable brushes in
goose, duck and crow quills should be employed; say one
goose, (for large grounds,) two duck (for ordinary work,)
and three crow (for fine linings on initials, &amp;c.) The red
sable is preferable to the brown sable, or other hair, as being
stronger and firmer at the point. An ordinary flat camel’s
hair brush will suffice for damping the back of gold paper,
washing over weak solutions of gum water or ox-gall, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>When gold leaf is used, a soft camel’s hair brush (of swan
quill size,) may be found useful for touching, smoothing, &amp;c.
For laying down the gold leaf, a very thin, flat brush is required,
called a gilder’s tip.</p>

<p>Burnishers are made of agate, and the following metallic
preparations are found useful in illuminating, viz: gold paper,
shell gold, saucer gold, shell silver, saucer silver, shell aluminum,
shell platina. Silver inevitably blackens. Aluminum
is preferable to silver.</p>

<p>Besides colors, materials to work upon, pens, brushes, burnisher,
tracer, and metallic preparations, there will be required
an eraser, compass, rule, pencil, India rubber, sponge, cotton
wood, some tracing paper and other small sundries. A bottle
of gum water will be necessary, and also one of liquid ox-gall.
A little of the former, mingled with water, is used to
impart brilliancy to colors.</p>

<p class="psh">COLORING.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> the head of materials, are given colors recommended
for illumination. Besides the colors in that list, several others
are requisite, that are only to be obtained by mixing on
the palette. These broken hues are employed in backgrounds,
and as shading for the more brilliant colors and tints
on the ornamentation.</p>

<p>There is only space in this book for a few practical directions
for laying on such colors as are named.</p>

<p>First, then, everything connected with the painting should be
scrupulously clean and free from dust. Distilled water should
be used, or at least soft water that is perfectly clear. A very
little gum water, in some cases, should be added to the color as
it is mixed. The sable pencils should be in readiness, two or
three, or more, according to the work and habits of the operator.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the best place to mention the manner of
using the Chinese white. On being taken from the bottle, it
is found to be exceedingly viscid, and troublesome to work,
clogging the point of the pencil. Of course it should be diluted
with pure water, but as this renders it too thin for the
firm and fine lines and dots so often wanted, it must be left
a few moments to evaporate and thicken; if still viscid, it
should be thinned again and left. White thus put out of the
tube and thinned, will be found to be even better for working
a day or two afterwards than at first. All that is required,
as it will be dry, is to dip the pencil in water before working
it upon the white, and make a good point before transferring
it to the illumination. Unless these precautions be observed,
the use of white will be attended with continual vexation.</p>

<p>When a compound color is required, sufficient for the work
in hand should be mixed up at one time, lest, more being required,
the second tint differ from the first, when a disagreeable
patchy appearance will ensue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Compound tints should be kept extremely clean in tone,
muddy or dirty tints being fatal to that exquisite purity of
colors for which illumination is so famed. It is a great mistake
to suppose that dark tints are necessarily somewhat dirty; ·
on the contrary, they can be kept as clean and clear in tone
as the most vivid combinations.</p>

<p>The following is a list of colors and mixed tints, stated
without technical phraseology, as far as possible:</p>

<p class="p2">Scientific formulas are not to be condemned, but in the present
state of the science of color, it is rash to say what is, and
what is not right, by law. In delicate harmonies, considerable
license must be allowed to what is called taste.</p>

<p>Whatever the numerical formulas may do in preventing us
from utterly disgusting ourselves, excellence in coloring can
only be attained by careful study of beautiful examples.</p>

<p>Reynolds’ maxim, of constant copying was practiced ages
before by the Italian masters; and it is so still, as the hundreds
and thousands of studies left by deceased artists testify.</p>

<p>Twenty good color studies, patiently copied, are worth all
the numerical formulas in the world. Nevertheless, to those
who are timid or inexperienced in judgment of color, a careful
study of Chevreul or Hay will not be without advantage,
and though it will not create the power to color harmoniously,
it will aid in its development.</p>

<p>If any one should attempt to copy a manuscript of the
fourteenth century or thereabouts, first cut the proper kind of
Bristol board the size the page is to be, and prepare it by rubbing
with pomice. Then, having sketched it out upon a board,
rule very lightly the lines for the margin, type and initial letter.
If the border be open, that is, upon a white ground, as
most of this period were, the outer marginal line will have to
be erased, so that it had better only be ruled in pencil. Next
the type must be printed according to the date, sketching the
capitals, which you will finish afterwards. The next thing to
be done is to copy the large initial letter, which must be done
with great care, testing its accuracy by tracing. If there is
to be any picture, then that must be next sketched. Your
outline cannot be too delicate. Last of all you will copy the
border, and that in the following way: fix your eye upon
some prominent portion of the border in the copy, and having
ascertained its exact position and dimensions, proceed to
mark it out upon the surface of your Bristol board. Measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
again the distance from this to the next most prominent
feature, and so on in like manner until you have all the most
important parts fixed in their proper places.</p>

<p>Now advance to the subordinate ornamental detail and
gradually fill that in, dividing your work into small portions
and taking the greatest care to have all correct. Do not rest
till you have a literal fac-simile of the original.</p>

<p>Now proceed to color; but first mix a little liquid ox-gall
with your colors, which will enable you to paint with ease and
certainty. The initial letter can be first finished, using the appropriate
colors. Next begin to color the border, applying
one tint wherever it is wanted all through it, then finishing
the next, and so on until you have all the colors laid on their
proper places. These you will proceed to shade and ornament
in solid Chinese white or gold; any little figures also or
grotesques should now be completed, including of course the
terminal line, generally of gold and color, which encloses the
type. When all these are finished and really accurate, both
in shape and color, if there be a picture, that comes next in
order; if not, you will put in any dots of color or flat gold
which may happen to adorn the background. This will conclude
the operation of copying, and any marks or spots which
have occurred in the course of your drawing can now be
erased with bread.</p>

<p class="psh">DESIGN.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you have any enthusiasm for this art, and have studied
manuscript of the best period of illumination, as has been advised,
you will not be content simply to copy the designs of
others, but will desire yourself to try and compose them. Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
it not our duty to try and develop to the extent of our power,
any art we cherish? Therefore let us consider the subject of
design and try to form some rules for our future guidance.</p>

<p>The first thing necessary to do, is to fix upon some existing
style of illumination to serve as a basis for any intended developments.
Of course this style must naturally be the best
and purest, and that is, as I have often said before, and as I
firmly believe, that which prevailed from the middle of the
thirteenth to the end of the fourteenth century. But you will
ask of what nature ornament is to be, and this leads to a rule,
that <i>ornamentation must consist of conventionalized representation
of natural objects</i>. All true beauty consists in the
representation of, or is derived from, natural objects. To
this rule there is no exception. But nature may be represented
in two ways, either by realizing her, as far as our
means will possibly allow, or by conventionalism. In realism,
we endeavor to obtain a literal copy of the object to be represented
and set no bounds to our pursuit of this.</p>

<p>In conventionalism, we beforehand arrange certain limits at
which to stop, and then get as much of nature as we can within
those limits.</p>

<p>Now in conventionalism it is to a great extent optional how
far you will realize your flowers or leaves. You may do it
more or less as you feel the occasion requires.</p>

<p>The principle appears to be to seize upon the leading characteristics
of the flower or form you wish to represent, and
then to add as much of the rest as you can consistently with
your subject. Thus, you may either represent a rose as an
arrangement of five leaves of a certain shape and color round
a yellow or gold central spot&mdash;as was the general mediæval
type&mdash;or you may go somewhat nearer the reality and add a
few more petals, &amp;c., so as to bring it to a closer resemblance.
You must arrange this with yourself, but as a rule observe
that the more you realize any flower the more you must proportionably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
increase the quantity of conventional ornament
around it, so as to make it evident that you had voluntarily
set yourself limits which you did not choose to pass. While
I am on this subject, I will take the opportunity to advise you
to make great use of leaves in your designs. Wonderful and
perfect as all nature’s work is, yet it seems as if the stamp of
perfection and divine beauty were more strongly impressed on
leaves than on any other of her productions. The thousand
changing forms of beauty with which she clothes the woods,
the banks, and the very ground we tread on, ought to be to
all, but especially to lovers of beauty and truth, objects of
the purest joy and delight. Make very frequent use of them
in designing, for they ever have been and ever will be sources
of the best and most heavenly beauty. Remember always
that in painting them it is far more important to have the
form and outline quite right and true, than to imitate or approach
their color, which may be left arbitrary. Remember
also that their power will be better felt by a somewhat sparing
use of them, I mean as regards not over-crowding your page,
so that though you may employ many leaves, you will have
but few of each.</p>

<p>The last rule of design is, that there <i>should be a general
purpose and meaning running throughout the ornamental detail</i>.
You should endeavor to carry out some idea in each
border, and to this end should reflect well, first what idea you
wish to give, next how, and by what means you may best convey
it. I will not say that your meaning will at once be plain
to every one, nor indeed is it likely to be so to more than a
few, but still the working with a deliberate idea in your mind
will give a unity and completeness to your design, which will
be entirely wanting to one worked out at random, or with a
view only to prettiness&mdash;the most noxious idea it is possible to
conceive, and the rock upon which nearly all modern illuminators
make shipwreck. Accustom yourself to ask not, “is this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
pretty?” but, “is it <i>right</i>?” and this habit will, I think,
be a safeguard to you.</p>

<p>The principles of design as applied to this art, have now
been considered. There are, it is true, many other points on
which I could speak, but as my space will not allow it, I have
chosen those which are the most important, and against which
there is to beginners the greatest temptation to err. Careful
study of the best manuscript you have an opportunity of
seeing, must be your guide on other points. But as an encouragement
let me tell you, that if you have any talent for
design, and will take the trouble diligently to <i>think</i> over the
directions here given and try them by such fourteenth century
examples as may fall in your way, I do not think that you
can go wrong in any material point. Difference of opinion
and taste there must always be, but as long as we grasp the
truth and resolutely cling to our landmarks, our steps cannot
go far astray.</p>

<p>These foregoing directions were prepared for this work by
a lady who excels in the art of illumination.</p>

<p class="dc13">DECALCOMANIE will be appreciated and
enjoyed by any one who takes pleasure in
making tasteful articles for gifts, or for contributions
to fairs, or in adding new graces to
the parlor. It consists in ornamenting vases
and boxes with oil paintings. The process
saves a great deal of labor, and when the
work is well done, very close examination is
necessary to detect the difference between
hand paintings and the Decalcomanie, particularly
if the pictures are retouched, or tiny sprays of moss,
small leaves, or flowers are added in water colors. The designs
can be transferred to wood, porcelain, leather, silk, glass,
metal, paper, etc.</p>

<p>The designs are printed in oil colors, on the surface of paper,
which has been previously prepared with a composition
easily soluble in water,&mdash;or in fact the printing is entirely on
this composition, the paper merely serving as a back to give
support to the thin film on which the design is printed. By
a process hereafter described, these beautiful designs in oil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
colors may be perfectly transferred to the surface of any article
which it is desirable to ornament, such as vases, card-cases,
porte-monnaies, work-boxes, needle-books, toilet-cushions, lamp-shades,
and hundreds of other things too numerous to mention;
and when nicely executed, the work equals the finest
painting. Beautiful bouquets may in this way, be transferred
to silk for toilet-cushions and perfume sachets.</p>

<p>When applied to china, porcelain or other similar substances,
it may be freely washed with warm water without injury,
and is in every respect as durable as oil painting.</p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh p2 font1">Materials.</p>

<p>The necessary materials are as follows: <i>cementing varnish</i>,
<i>protecting varnish</i>, two or three <i>camel’s hair brushes</i> of various
sizes, (these should be of fine quality, as the cheaper ones
never have good points), a glass of <i>clear water</i>, a small vial
of benzine or burning fluid for cleaning the varnish brushes;
and be careful and procure suitably prepared pictures.</p>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh p2 font1">Directions.</p>

<p>First, with a fine brush, apply the cementing varnish to
every part of the picture, following the outline neatly without
running over on the white paper. After applying the varnish
let it dry a minute, then, holding the picture to the
light, take a larger brush and dampen the back with water,
being careful to wet the size of the design only. Before the
picture has time to expand much, apply the picture to the
article to be ornamented, firmly pressing every part; dampen
again with water, after which remove the paper. To remove
the paper, commence at one corner and carefully raise it,
keeping close watch that none of the design adheres to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
paper. If a piece, however small, is seen attached to the paper,
immediately replace the paper and again press that part
to the article and perhaps dampen a little more. Having entirely
removed the paper, draw a damp cloth smoothly over
the finger and firmly press every part, using great care that
no air bubbles remain under the large surfaces. The day
after the transfer, carefully wash the design with cold water,
and when perfectly dry, lightly apply the protecting varnish
to the design. The above directions are strictly applicable to
ornamenting only such articles as can be washed.</p>

<p>In ornamenting any delicate substance, such as silk, great
care must be observed in dampening the back, in order to
dampen only the exact size of the design; as, if the preparation
on the paper is dampened around the picture, it will
soil the silk. Of course the washing above mentioned must be
omitted; and oftentimes the varnishing may also be omitted to
advantage, as its object is simply to render the painting more
durable, where it is to be subjected to use or exposed to the
weather.</p>

<p>In order to avoid soiling delicate substances, some persons
have adopted the following expedients:&mdash;After applying the
cementing varnish to the picture, and before dampening the
back, take the water brush, and thoroughly wet the face of
the paper all around the design. This will soften the preparation,
which may be removed by carefully touching the surface
with a wet cloth. The cloth, being wet, will not stick to the
varnish if it comes in contact with it. After this operation,
the process is the same as before described, except that some
of the fine parts near the edge may require retouching with
the cementing varnish.</p>

<p>For ornamenting any dark substances, such as black silk or
a rosewood box, the picture is differently prepared. After the
picture has been printed in all its colors, the whole design is
entirely covered with gold leaf or a preparation of white lead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
which is merely to give the picture its proper effect, by preventing
the dark surface from showing through, which it
would do at every light part were it not for this backing.
But if it is desirable to use some pictures not backed on a
dark ground, it may be done by covering the design with a
preparation of fine white lead, called white grounding. The
grounding must be allowed to dry, and then the process is the
same as before. In applying your pictures to any article,
face the light, and, holding the picture before you, the design
can be seen from the back, and thus correctly placed in
position.</p>

</div>

<p class="psh">ENGRAVED BOXES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> box should be white or light straw-color in order to
show the faint impression to advantage. It should be varnished
five or six times in succession, and suffered to dry
thoroughly each time. While the last coat of varnish is yet
so fresh that your finger will adhere to it, the engraving must
be put on, the picture side next to the varnish. The engraving
must be prepared in the following manner:&mdash;All the
white paper must be cut off close to the edges of the engraving,
which must be laid on a clean table, with the picture downward,
and moistened all over with a clean sponge. It must
then be placed between two leaves of blotting paper, to dry
it a little. Before putting it on the box, take great care to have
it even, and determine exactly where you wish it to be. Lay
one edge of the print, picture downward, upon the varnish,
and gradually drop it to its place, passing the hand successively
over the back of the print in such a manner as to drive
out all the air, and prevent the formation of blisters. Then
carefully touch it all over with a linen cloth, so as to be sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
every part adheres to the varnish. Leave it until it is thoroughly
dry. Then moisten the back of the engraving with a
clean sponge, and rub it lightly backward and forward with
the fingers, so as to remove the moistened paper in small
rolls. When the picture begins to appear, take great care
lest you rub through, and take off some of the impression.
As soon as you perceive there is danger of this, leave it to
dry. In drying, the engraving will disappear, because it is
still covered by a slight film of paper. You might think it
mere white paper; but give it a coat of varnish, and it will
become quite transparent. Should you by accident have
removed any part of the engraving, touch it with India ink,
and gum water, in order that no white spots may appear; but
when you put on your second coat of varnish you must take
care to pass very lightly over the spots you have retouched.
The box should be varnished as many as three times after the
engraving has been placed on it, and suffered to dry thoroughly
each time. The white alcoholic varnish is the best.
It should be put on in the sunshine, or near a warm stove.
After the last coat is well dried, sift a little pulverized rotten
stone through coarse muslin, and rub it on with linseed oil
and a soft rag; after being well rubbed, cleanse the box thoroughly
with an old silk handkerchief or soft linen rag. Some
persons say that a very thin sizing of nice glue should be put
on the box before it is varnished at all; others say it is not
necessary. This work requires great patience and care; but
the effect is very beautiful, and pays for the trouble.</p>

your basket, twigs, &amp;c., and dip them into the solution till
they are well dyed. Some persons dissolve red sealing-wax
in alcohol, and form coral, powder the wax, and fill in as
much as the alcohol will dissolve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Success</span> in these baskets depends somewhat upon chance;
for the crystals will sometimes form irregularly, even when
the utmost care is taken. Dissolve alum in a little more than
twice as much water as will be necessary to cover the basket,
handle and all. Put in as much alum as the water will dissolve.
The water should be hot. When the water is entirely
saturated, pour it into a sauce-pan or earthen jar, (by no
means put it into an iron vessel), and slowly boil it, until it is
nearly evaporated. The basket should then be suspended
from a little stick, laid across the top of the jar, in such a
manner that both basket and handle will be covered by the
solution. It must be set away in a cool place, where not
the slightest motion will disturb the formation of the crystals.</p>

<p>The frame may be made in any shape you fancy. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
usually made of small wire, woven in and out like basket-work;
but a common willow basket may be used for a frame.
Whether it be wire or willow, a rough surface must be produced
by winding every part with thread or worsted. Bonnet-wire
already covered can be used, and the trouble of
winding the basket avoided. Bright yellow crystals may be
produced by boiling gamboge, saffron or tumeric in the alum
solution. Litmus boiled in will give bright red crystals; logwood
will form purple. The colors will be more or less deep
according to the quantity used. Splendid blue crystals may
be obtained by preparing the sulphate of copper, commonly
called blue vitriol, in the same manner as alum is prepared.
Care must be taken not to drop it on your clothes.</p>

<p class="psh">PAINTING ON GLASS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> of the works which profess to teach the art of painting
on glass contain directions for staining large windows in
churches and halls; others merely give the process of producing
the more common paintings, such as are carried about
the streets for sale. These seem to have been much in vogue
about a century since, as all the “Young Artist’s Assistants”
of that day contain the mode of painting them. They direct
us to fix a mezzotinto print upon the back of a sheet of
glass, and to remove the paper by wetting and rubbing, leaving
the impression of the print, which is afterwards to be
painted in broad washes; the ink of the print giving the
shadows. The picture being then turned over, the glazed
side becomes the front, and the colors first laid on are, of
course, nearest the eye. This mode of painting resembles
the style of Grecian painting, that being painted from the
back, and the shading is the ink of the engraving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The methods by which glass is stained are scientific; they
require some knowledge of chemistry, and such apparatus as
must preclude the practice of this branch of art as an amusement.
It may be interesting, however, to know something
of the process. The glass being, at first, colorless, a drawing
is made upon it, and the painting is laid on with mineral
substances, the vehicle being a volatile oil, which soon evaporates.
The sheets of glass are then exposed to a powerful
heat, until they are so far melted that they receive the colors
into their own substances. Enamel painting is done on the
same principle. This is a time of great anxiety to the
artist, as with all possible care, valuable paintings, both in
glass and enamel, are frequently spoiled in the proving, or
vitrification. The art seems to have been lost during several
centuries, but it has of late been successfully revived; and
large windows have been executed for churches and gothic
halls, which almost vie with the fine old specimens in the
cathedrals, in point of color, while they far excel them in
other respects.</p>

<p>The branch of the art which may be treated as an accomplishment
is the decoration of glass, flower-stands, lamp-shades,
and similar articles, with light and elegant designs.
Flowers, birds, butterflies and pleasing landscapes, afford an
extensive range of subjects, which are suitable to this style of
ornamental painting. The glasses may be procured ready
ground. The outline may be sketched in with a black lead
pencil; the lead can be washed off with a sponge when the
colors are dry. The whole of the colors employed must be
transparent, and ground in oil; opaque, or body colors, will
not answer the purpose.</p>

<p>They may be purchased in small bladders, only requiring
to be tempered with fine copal or mastic varnish, and a very
little nut oil, to be ready for use. Blue is produced by Prussian
blue; red, by scarlet or crimson lake; yellow, by yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
lake or gamboge; green, by verdigris, or mineral green, or a
mixture of Prussian blue and gamboge; purple, by a mixture
of lake and Prussian blue; reddish brown, by burnt
sienna; and all the other tints may be obtained by combinations;
for white, or such parts as are required to be transparent,
without color, the varnish only should be employed. A
very chaste and pleasing effect may be produced by painting
the whole design in varnish, without color.</p>

<p>It is an advantage to this style of painting, that but few
colors are required; as from the nature of the subjects, and
their purpose as ornaments, brilliancy is more desirable than
a nice gradation of tints. The work must, of course, be carefully
dried, but may afterwards be cleaned with a sponge
and cold water.</p>

<p class="psh">PAINTING ON VELVET.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Painting</span> on velvet as well as on glass is an old art revived.
No art that is really beautiful in itself will pass away entirely.
As these paintings are very pleasing to the eye, and easy of
execution, it is well to know how to paint them. The following
directions are taken from a reliable English work.</p>

<p>The colors for this style of painting are sold at the drawing
material warehouses, in a liquid state and prepared for use.
In addition to these, a brilliant rose color is obtained from the
pink saucers, by dropping a little weak gum water upon the
color, and rubbing it with a brush. A deep yellow may also
be produced by pouring a few drops of boiling water upon a
small quantity of hay saffron.</p>

<p>It is necessary to mix gum water with all the colors made,
to prevent their spreading into each other; gum dragon is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
best for this purpose. The brushes used are called scrubs;
they consist of a small stick, with a camel’s hair brush cut off
quite short at one end, and at the other, a brush of bristles
of a much harder description. A small box of black lead is
necessary, and a piece of list rolled tightly round, to the diameter
of about two inches, to be used as a sort of brush with
the black lead, for making outlines in the manner we shall
presently direct. A piece of linen rag, to wipe the brushes
on, should also be provided.</p>

<p>The most brilliant flowers, fruits, shells, birds, &amp;c., are
well adapted to this style of painting. The outline of the
subject may be sketched in pencil on the velvet, which is of
such a very delicate nature, that the greatest nicety is necessary
to keep it in a state of neatness. Care should also be
taken that the sketch is correctly made, as an error cannot be
effaced by rubbing out, as on paper. It is a safer method,
however, to make the sketch on drawing-paper, and to prick
the outline very closely with a fine needle; then, the velvet
being previously nailed on a flat piece of wood of a proper
size, the pricked pattern may be laid over it, the roll of list
dipped into the black lead powder, and rubbed regularly over
the pattern from side to side; be careful to touch every part,
and on removing the pattern, a perfect outline in black dots
will appear on the velvet.</p>

<p>Where a set of articles of the same pattern is undertaken,
this is a very good plan, as it ensures accuracy, and saves the
trouble of making separate sketches.</p>

<p>Even those who have no knowledge of drawing on paper
may produce a design on velvet, with ease and correctness,
by tracing off against a window, or by means of tracing paper,
any drawing or print which they wish to copy, and pricking
the tracing on the velvet in the manner just described.
In order to keep the margin of the velvet from being soiled
in the progress of painting, a piece of thick paper should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
laid over the whole, and an aperture cut in the middle, sufficiently
large to expose the part to be worked on. Each brush
should be kept for that color alone to which it has once been
appropriated.</p>

<p>A small quantity of the color about to be used should be
poured into a little cup, and a drop of gum water added, and
stirred with the stick of a pencil prior to its being taken on
the brush. The mode of its application is so simple, that a
short description of the execution of a single flower will suffice
to give an idea of the process of painting almost any other
subject on velvet. A very small portion of color is to be
taken upon the brush, and the darkest part of the leaf touched
with it; the brush is then to be dipped in water, and the
color gradually softened to the edge; each leaf ought to be
colored separately, and the darkest parts in the centre of the
flowers may be finished with a small brush without softening.
India ink is used to make the dark shadows of crimson flowers.
The veins, and all the petals of flowers, and all the
fine lines, should be done with a pen. Each leaf, as it is
shadowed, should be brushed with the hard end of a brush,
that way of the velvet in which the pile runs most easily, and
then in the contrary direction, so as to set it up again to become
dry. A deeper shade should never be added to a leaf
or flower until the color previously laid on is perfectly set, or
the two colors will spread and run into each other, this will be
prevented by the gum, if sufficient time can be allowed for
each shade to dry before a subsequent one is applied.</p>

<p>When the piece is finished, and quite dry, it should be
brushed over with a small, round brush, about two inches in
diameter, with hard bristles of an equal length, to raise up
such parts of the pile as may have been flattened in the process
of painting.</p>

<p>Toilet-sets, sofa-cushions, fancy tables, pin-cushions, and a
variety of articles may be ornamented in this way.</p>

<p class="psh">CASTING IN PLASTER, SULPHUR, <span class="smcap">Etc.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Taking</span> the impression of coins, medals, &amp;c., is, independently
of its utility, a most interesting amusement. This art
is of considerable importance to collectors of antique coins,
&amp;c. It is often difficult, and always expensive, to purchase
superior specimens, of which, however, exact models may be
obtained by casting, without the slightest injury to the originals.
The mould is made in the following manner:&mdash;Take
a strip of paper, a quarter or third of an inch wide; roll it
twice tight around the rim of the coin, or gem, of which a
cast is intended to be taken, and fasten the end with very
stiff gum-water, which will hold it instantly. Rub a very
little oil, with a camels-hair pencil, over the coin, in order to
prevent the plaster from sticking; then mix some fine plaster
of Paris, with as much water as will make it almost as thick
as treacle; apply it quickly to the coin, on which it will be
held by the paper rim. It sets almost instantly, and may be
taken off in a few hours; but the longer it remains undisturbed
the better. The mould which is thus obtained is the reverse
of the coin; that is, the impression is concave, like a seal.
When the moulds are so dry that they will not wrinkle a
piece of paper laid flat upon the surface, let them be well saturated
with the best boiled linseed oil, placing the moulds
with their surface upward, that the whole of the oil may be
absorbed. They must be covered from dust, and nothing
should touch their surface, lest they suffer injury. Moulds,
well prepared in this manner, and dried about two days
after being oiled, will stand a long time, for the casting of
either plaster or sulphur. When used, either Florence oil or
a little hog’s lard (the latter to be preferred) should be applied
very tenderly over the mould with a little of the finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
cotton wool, and the cotton wool, without lard, afterwards
passed lightly over the surface, to leave as little as possible
of the unctuous matter upon the mould, that the casts may be
the finer. Put paper around them, as was before done to the
coin; pour on plaster in the same manner, and a fac-simile
of the original will be produced.</p>

<p>Good casts may be made of sulphur, melted in an iron
ladle, either pure, or colored with a little red lead or vermilion
powdered and stirred up with it. The moulds and casts
are made in the same manner as with plaster of Paris, only
that the sulphur must be poured on the mould when hot, and
water, instead of oil, must be used, to prevent adhesion.
Sulphur makes the best moulds for plaster casts, and <i>vice
versa</i>&mdash;as similar substances can seldom be prevented, by
either water or oil, from adhering, in some degree, to each
other. Plaster cannot be used twice; that is, old or spoiled
casts cannot be powdered and again employed; for the
moment the material is moistened, being a species of lime, it
is no longer plaster, without being reburnt.</p>

<p>Another way of making casts of almost any color, is with
a strong solution of isinglass; it must be used when quite
hot; and it is so thin that a box, exactly fitting the rim of
the coin, is required, otherwise it will escape. It may be
colored with saffron, wood, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Very beautiful impressions may be taken by pouring melted
wax upon the metal, which comes off easily when the wax and
metal are perfectly cold; but any one attempting this had better
try it first upon a penny, or other coin of little value.</p>

<p>Impressions may also be taken in wax, which, for this purpose,
should be rendered pliable by kneading it with the hand
before the fire, a little oil having been previously mixed with
it. When softened to about the consistency of putty, lay it
and press it close down on the coin, the form of which will
then be perfectly obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is another mode of taking impressions:&mdash;Procure
tin or lead foil, as thin as possible, place it on the
coin, and with a pin’s head, or any small, smooth instrument,
work it into every part; then take it off, revert it into a shallow
box, and pour plaster into its concave side; a durable
plaster cast is thus obtained, covered with tin foil, which will
resemble silver.</p>

<p class="psh">LEATHER WORK.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">“The</span> Complete Guide to Ornamental Leather Work”
gives very elaborate directions, the more practical of which
are given in this chapter in connection with suggestions derived
from other sources. Being quite absorbed at one time
in imitating various kinds of flowers and leaves in leather,
and in ornamenting and staining wood to represent beautiful
carved work,&mdash;the writer of this examined the books on the
subject, and tried many elaborate methods, and finally went
to a cabinet-maker and learned the simplest mode of staining
and varnishing. Her leather work proved to be quite as durable,
and was pronounced as handsome, as if it had been covered
with various coats of stiffening.</p>

<p>The kind of leather used for general purposes is basil; it
should be selected of an even texture and of a light color, as
the light colored will stain better than the dark. It should
be soft and free from blemishes.</p>

<p>The skiver leather is used for making grapes, or very small
leaves and flowers, and can be obtained at the same place as
the basil leather; this kind is also useful for thin stems and
any minute portion of the work.</p>

<p>The whole skins are very expensive, and any one who wishes
to experiment can obtain for quite a small sum pieces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
leather from trunk-makers and saddlers, (who call it sheepskin
instead of basil;) you can engage them to save you all
their pieces; in this way you can obtain all you will wish to
use. You can also purchase strips of thicker leather at the
same places, to ornament the edge of your brackets, &amp;c.; you
can cut the edge of the leather in scollops, points, &amp;c., with
chisels and gouges, and nail it round the shelf or glue it on,
the scollops, &amp;c., hanging down; it will look exactly like
wood when properly stained. Then nail your flowers to that.
Pieces of skiver can also be obtained from the book-binders.
To form your leaves and flowers, you must sketch your pattern
from nature, on pasteboard. Then dip your leather in
cold water for half a minute (not longer, unless the leather
is unusually thick;) it should then be taken from the water
and pressed in a linen cloth until the surface is nearly dry.
Being thus prepared, lay it quite flat on a board, and place upon
it your pasteboard pattern, and trace it. While the leather
is wet, cut out your leaf with sharp scissors or a shoe-maker’s
knife. The pattern may be drawn before the leather is wet,
and if sharp tools are used the leaf can be cut before wetting
it; and by drawing one pattern and nailing several pieces of
leather firmly on a board, with chisels, gouges and hammer,
you can cut a number of leaves at once, and then neatly trim
them with the scissors. All common leaves, such as grape,
ivy, or convolvulus, are more easily cut in this way; rose
leaves and grape leaves are cut better with the scissors. You
should have a variety of sizes of leaves. To vein the leaves
you should copy nature, and mark them with a brad awl or
knitting needle, or the point of the scissors; press heavily for
thick veins and lightly for the finer veins; by using the two
points of your scissors slightly spread apart, you can form the
raised veins; a hard steel pen can be used for the smaller
veins. Being veined, the leaves should be bent and moulded
into the required shape. Then they should be dried quickly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
as it hardens them better. Some persons stiffen them when
dry by brushing over a stiffening made of two ounces of Australian
red gum, six ounces of orange shellac, half a pint of
spirits of wine, mixed cold, and when dissolved, strained for
use. It is not necessary to use any such preparation when
your leather work is sufficiently hardened by drying; take
some asphaltum varnish and stain it carefully all over with a
brush. This varnish you can buy ready mixed, or you can
get the asphaltum, powder it, and dissolve it in spirits of turpentine;
when well dried it will probably need a second coat,
possibly a third, depending on the color you wish, whether
dark or light; when well dried, varnish the work with copal
varnish, and dry it thoroughly. Then stain your wood (or
you can have it stained at the cabinet-makers, as you prefer.)
You can stain even common pine wood by the following process:
first, stain with asphaltum the color you desire; then
varnish with three coats of copal varnish, having each well
dried; when it is dry and hard, rub it down with powdered
pumice stone, and wash off with clear cold water. Then arrange
and nail, or glue, on your leather flowers or fruit.
When all is complete, finish up with a coat of copal varnish
carefully brushed on.</p>

<p>To make stems and tendrils: cut strips as long as the
leather will allow; soak them well in water for a few minutes
until they feel very soft; take them out, wipe the water from
the surface, roll them and dry them; if required to be very
stiff, add inside a piece of wire; when very thick ones are required
the leather may be cut wider. Tendrils are made in
the same manner as stems, using skiver instead of the ordinary
leather; dry them quickly, then take a strip, damp it
and wind it round a brad awl or knitting needle, taking care
to fasten both ends, so that it cannot fly off; dry it by the fire,
then remove it from the awl or needle, and a delicately formed
tendril will be the result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Every kind of flower can be imitated. Oak leaves and
acorns are easily made, and many prefer them to flowers.
Take several sizes of natural oak leaves, and draw the pattern
on pasteboard, and pencil them as the natural leaf is veined.
These you can keep always ready to copy your leather from.
The natural acorn can be used, by leaving a little of the stem
on the cup, on which to glue a longer stem of leather; then
glue the acorn into the cup, and varnish and stain. If you
can obtain sprays of acorns, and glue each acorn to its cup
and glue on a bit of leather to the end of the stem, to nail
to your frame, they are the most desirable. The acorns gathered
from the shrub oak are the prettiest.</p>

<p>Convolvulus is a vine most commonly imitated. The
leaves and tendrils are very simple, and the flower is easily
shaped over the top of a bottle. First, cut a round piece the
size of a half dollar, and punch a hole in the centre after
it is wet, then shape from the natural flower; the cup can be
formed in the neck of the bottle, and the rest by rolling the
edges over the rim of the top of the bottle.</p>

<p>Ivy is easily made. The berries can be formed from slack
baked bread; take it and roll into little berries, then stick in
each a piece of wire (that pulled from wire taste is the best,
as it is wound with thread,) and in forming the branch wind
the wires together with a strip of leather. When the berries
have hardened, stain them.</p>

<p>Grapes are made of skiver, and either small clay marbles
or dry peas. First, wet your skiver, then form your bunch
of grapes, by pushing one after another firm into the pliant
leather, and fasten around each a linen thread, and draw
them with it close together, shaping your bunch according to
the size you wish. They so perfectly imitate carved wood
that persons familiar with carving may be deceived by them.
By the exercise of ingenuity and your imitative qualities you
can accomplish very satisfactory results. Parts of the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
may be gilded, if you prefer. For instance, you may gild
your acorns, grapes or ivyberries. Bronzing is pretty for
some kinds of work. It is done by sprinkling or rubbing
bronzing powder on the work before the last coat of varnish
is dry.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc200">SKELETON BRACKET.</p>

<p>Autumn leaves can be imitated by using finely powdered
colors, and mixing them to the consistence of cream, with the
following medium:&mdash;Mix the white of an egg with 2 oz. of
pure distilled vinegar; put them into a bottle and shake them
well together whenever you wish to mix your colors; or mix
them with parchment size warmed, or a weak solution of gum-Arabic;
in either case, varnish with a quick drying pale varnish.
Oil colors will not answer.</p>

<p>Pieces of furniture easily ornamented by leather are book

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc200">DESIGN FOR A BRACKET.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The edges of frames of all kinds may be neatly ornamented
by taking two strips about seven-eighths of an inch
wide, cut them as long as possible,
and stain them; when ready for
use, nail them together to the edge
of the frame, then twist them round so
as to form a point, and nail again, and
so on all around, crossing them each
time. Brackets need to be formed
not only artistically, but strong. I
will give here a design for the framework,
before the leather ornaments are
nailed on. The strips of wood must
be entirely covered with the leather foliage; it adds to the appearance
of the whole.</p>

<p>To gild the upper edge, I will also give a pretty design for
an oak and ivy bracket. This is intended to imitate old oak,
and should be stained very dark. The oak stem should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
made of very thick wire, cut in the desired lengths, and covered
with leather, and bent to resemble
gnarled oak, as naturally
as possible; fasten oak leaves and
acorns at the back of the wires and
on the wood-work, as shown in the
skeleton bracket, then attach the ivy
tendrils, leaves and berries around
the oak stems, and the bracket is
complete. Other and very beautiful
designs will readily occur to
persons who engage in this delightful
recreation.</p>

<p class="psh">CIGAR-BOXES MADE USEFUL.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beautiful</span> fancy boxes can be made from cigar-boxes, if
the cover is preserved whole. Small sizes are the most
desirable. Toilet, glove, handkerchief, gentlemen’s collar,
note paper and work-boxes, besides many other varieties, are
easily manufactured. The materials required, most of which
can be purchased at the paper box manufactories, are:&mdash;All
kinds of fancy enamel paper, in sheets; gold or silver paper,
and the gold or fancy beadings, which can be bought in strips;
small enamel German pictures; plain or water-colored paper, or
colored silk and satins, for the lining; gilded corner-pieces, and
claw-feet are an addition; perfume powder, narrow taste, &amp;c.</p>

<p>First, you must fasten the lid firmly by pasting a strip of
linen along the edges of the lid and box, inside, as well as outside;
it holds the lid firm, and acts as a hinge; paste on each side
bits of ribbon to support the lid, then glue in the lining. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
very nice boxes, silk or satin, fluted, is a great addition.
Plait it above and below on a narrow piece of paper, and
paste the edges down; then take an oblong piece of silk and
another of paper, place a piece of cotton wool on the paper
sprinkled with perfume powder, then cover with the silk, and
baste the paper over the edge, pasting the whole on the lid in
the center. After you have covered it, paste neatly round it
a gold beading (or bind the edges of the box first with gold
paper); close the box when the inside is finished, and commence
on the outside. Some persons take out the bottom of
the box in lining it, as it is easier to paste it smoothly, and
then nail it in its place. Cover the whole outside of the box
with polished enamel paper (Japanese paper is very beautiful,
but expensive,) and cover the bottom of the box; then bind
the edges of the box with gold paper, and place beading on
the edge where it meets the colored paper. The styles may
be varied by pasting gold beading in stripes all over the box;
ornament the sides, if you prefer, with pictures. On the lid,
gold corner-pieces, besides the beading, are an improvement.
In the center place some pretty picture, varnish it with map
varnish, and then frame the picture with a gold beading. A
loop of ribbon should be pasted on the lid to raise it by, and
your box is finished. If your box is for gloves or handkerchiefs,
you may cut out in old Roman or English letters, in
gold paper, “Gantes” or “Mouchoir,” and paste them on
the front side of the box. Pin-cushions could be fastened on
the top of toilet boxes.</p>

<p>The pictures and gilding that come on linen or cambric
goods may be used for this purpose. Common flour paste is
the best; a little common glue mixed in while boiling improves
the paste. Mucilage can be used to glue on the beading.
The paper should be thoroughly wet with paste. Begin
to paste smoothly from the center, in order to keep out
all air.</p>

<p class="psh">POTICHIMANIE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potichimanie</span> is the art of imitating painting on glass or
China. The most beautiful of the Chinese porcelain, Sevres,
Japanese or Etruscan vases, can be so closely imitated, that
none but connoisseurs can discover at first sight, the difference.
The work is attractive, and very simple; the materials
employed are few, and inexpensive.</p>

<p>First, select some plain glass vases, resembling in shape
and size the particular style of China you wish to represent.
You can have vases of any shape blown and fashioned for
you at the glass houses.</p>

<p>Select your colored figures, representing the style of China
you wish to imitate; let them be rich, and clear in their
colors. You will need two or three small brushes, such
as painters use, some strong gum water, and a bottle of
varnish. Use paint for the groundwork of the color you
wish to represent. The ground color of the Chinese porcelain
is in general a greenish white; the Sevres a bluish
white; while the Etruscan is a pale yellow. These three
colors are generally all that are wanted. A delicate pink is
sometimes used. For any one kind of vase, only one ground
color is necessary. A pair of very fine pointed scissors will
also be required.</p>

<p>Then proceed to cut out your figures with great care; if
you can cut a trifle within your figures, all the better, for no
white edges must be visible. When they are all cut, arrange
them on a sheet of paper in the order in which they are to be
placed in the vase, and gum them very evenly and carefully
on the colored side; let them lay until the gum rather
thickens and the paper on which they are colored softens;
then take them up carefully and place them in their proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
places on the inside of your vase; press them carefully with
a bit of old linen tight to the glass, excluding all air between
them and the glass, otherwise bubbles will be formed, and
the work will be spoiled. When all the pictures are arranged,
wipe the glass clean, except where it is covered by the pictures.
After the work is dry and clean, varnish the back of
the prints, and paint the inside of the vase with the ground
color. Some persons pour it in the vase, and let it run
around, and then carefully brush it on; some put it on near
the pictures by gently tapping the glass with the brush.
Great care must be taken not to let the paint run under the
paintings. The antennae of butterflies and other minute
objects may be imitated in gold, or by drawing them on
the glass with gum water and sprinkling them with gold
bronze powder. This must be done before the ground paint
is laid. Gold stars scattered over some kinds of vases may
improve them. You can buy sheets of appropriate designs
already colored. If you prefer to color them yourself, you
must be sure and have your colors clear and bright; the
brighter they are the better they will appear. Where gold
is introduced, it is better to use the shell or prepared gold.
It is applied in the same manner as water colors, and may
be used with good effect, in borders, single ornaments, flowers,
insects, and to fill up when no other color is introduced.
This work may be used in various ways to decorate your
homes. The inside of your vase should be varnished, to give
it the smoothness of China, and you can have the rim gilded.
If several coats of sizing are applied, the vase may be filled
with water without injury to the paint; but you can fit cups
to the vases, in which to put water for flowers. Hall lamps,
windows, &amp;c., are decorated in the same manner, except that
no ground color is used. Cabinet boxes, tables, and a great
variety of other articles, both useful and ornamental, may, with
a little ingenuity and taste, be rendered extremely elegant.</p>

<p class="psh">ORNAMENTS IN RICE SHELL-WORK.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rice shells are brought from the West Indies, and are
sold by measure, or by the box, at the conchological repositories.
They can be bought already prepared for use, but are
more expensive in that form. To prepare the rough shell for
use, you must first take a long pin and free the interior of
each shell from all grit or dirt; next with your scissors clip
the extreme tip of the shell so as to leave a tiny hole like the
eye of a needle. This must be carefully done or the shell
will be spoiled, or your eyes may be seriously injured by the
flying fragments. Practice soon enables one to clip them rapidly
and evenly.</p>

<p>It is advisable to have at hand a number of small card
boxes, to hold your articles. In clipping, it is well to sort the
shells by the sizes, and lay them in separate boxes. Small,
flat, white shells, nearly transparent, add to the beauty of
the shell-work. These must be bored by a sharp needle
near the stem. When all are clipped, pour over them cold
water, with a little soda and castile soap. The latter should
be shredded, and mixed in the proportion of half an ounce to
each pint of water. Then cover your pan and place it near
a good fire, or in an oven; let it remain till scalding hot,
stirring now and then; then take it away, and rub the shells
gently with your hands; then pour off the water and rinse
the shells; add a fresh supply of water and soap only, and
repeat the same process; after being again rinsed in clear
water take a few shells, fold them in a soft towel to dry them,
and afterwards rub them with a silk handkerchief; then place
them in a dish near the fire and shake them occasionally till
they are dry. Then place them in a box ready for use. They
should appear polished and pearly white. Too much soap,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
soda, or heat will turn them yellow. Too great heat in drying
will cause them to be brittle and crack, but they must be dry
before using.</p>

<p>Next you must procure silver wire. This can be bought at
gold and silver bullion makers, or at musical instrument
makers. You need several sizes, the very finest thread wire
to wind around the stems, a size to twist in the shell and another
for stems.</p>

<p>The largest shells are better for baskets and heavier work,
the middle size and smallest for flowers and leaves. Each
kind should have its own box. Into one box cut some two
or three hundred pieces of middle sized wire, about two and
a half inches in length. You should collect for use various
materials, such as floss silk, fine wire chenille, roman pearl
beads, (the solid or grain-like bead is preferable,) coral beads,
or turquoise, pink, green or yellow, red flower seeds, velvet,
satin, or silver leaves and silver bullion. Having collected
materials for a wreath and sprays of various flowers, commence
your work by stringing your shells on your
bits of wire. Turn the wire over the shell; hold the
folded wire between thumb and finger of the right
hand, and turn the shell round and round until the
wires are firmly twisted together. Very soon you
will be astonished at the rapidity with which you
string and twist your shells. They look like this cut,
when prepared. Much time will be saved by keeping
your different sized shells separate. Having wired
several hundred, you can proceed to prepare a leaf.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc100">WIRED SHELLS.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The cut at the head of page 122 shows the leaf when
made. It takes from five to fifteen or twenty shells to form a
leaf; the number depends on the size of the leaf. The
smallest shell forms the apex, the others graduated in size by
pairs. Then take your shells and bind them together, one by
one, with the finest wire or floss silk, leaving out a small portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of the twisted wire, gradually increasing the piece left
out, as the plate indicates, leaving all the
openings of the shell all one way; bind
the stem firmly, leaving no ends of wire,
as they catch in everything, besides looking
untidy.</p>

<div class="floatright">

         title="" />
     <div class="cf"><p class="pc100">SHELL-LEAF.</p>
</div></div>

<p>To form a flower or bud, take one of the
lengths of the wire, thread on a shell, and
then a pearl bead, then a second shell, and
twist the wire firm. The place of the bead
is between the points of the two shells, and
both openings meet and are not seen. The
figure below shows a simple flower composed
of five wired shells, firmly twisted together down to the
extremity. A double flower is composed of
eighteen shells, twelve small ones, and six
of a middle size. These latter are arranged
as in the single flower. The twelve are
made into four leaflets. A few pearl beads
in the center of the flower improves it. It is
easy to shape them as you wish by bending
the wires. A simple flower may be arranged like the spokes
of a wheel.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc150">SHELL-FLOWER.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Wheat ears (see cut on next page) may be made of any
number of shells, from eight to thirty, one taken as an apex,
then a pair set on either side of it and one in the center, and
other pairs successively to the end, binding all firmly to the
points of the shells, and putting in here and there three quarter
inch length of middle sized wire to resemble the beards.
Ornamental groups can be made by threading good sized
shells on middle sized wires, twisting them together and winding
them on a fine knitting needle. When drawn out they
have a spiral form. Bind several thus formed together at the
ends. Their dancing, wavy motion adds to the gracefulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of your spray or wreath. The white, round shells used as
leaves are very pretty; even whole flowers are
often made of them. Wire chenille and colored
beads increase the effect.</p>

<div class="floatright">

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc100">WHEAT EARS.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Neatness and grace must be studied, care must
be used to avoid cutting off the thread wire, or
floss, any oftener than possible. In making
wreaths and sprays every one must exercise his or
her own taste. Infinite varieties of forms can be
designed; you can trim a head-dress exquisitely
with them.</p>

<p>I advise young ladies to try their skill. It is
fascinating work and the effect is beautiful. Bridal
wreaths formed of the rice shells, Roman pearls,
white chenille, and silver wire are often made.
Bugle flowers can be made in the same way, taking
wire the color of the bead.</p>

<p>Shell baskets are very ornamental. Exquisite watch stands
and cigar or match stands can be formed of shells. Your
frames should be made of wood or tin. Cover them thick
with white paint. The painters will prepare it for you as
thick as putty, with boiled oil. Paint must be selected that
will not turn yellow and will dry quickly. After covering
your frame thickly with this preparation, lay on the shells in
whatever form your own taste may direct. Place them so
thick that none of the paint will be visible, and set the frame
aside until it is dry. The drying may require several days.
When it is dry varnish it with white map varnish.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Watch stands, in the form of a church or other building,
may be made with a tin frame. Rolls of tin may be used
for columns and towers, and soldered to the frame. A circular
opening must be made in the frame through which the
watch can be seen, and a small case of tin must be soldered
to the back of the frame in which the watch can be held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
firmly. Take two blocks of wood similar in form, but one of
them larger than the other, and glue the smaller one on top
of the other; then
make a slit along the
middle line of the upper
block, in which the
tin frame is to be inserted
and fastened
with glue. The blocks
will represent the steps
to the building, and
may be covered with
shells. If the building
represents a church, a
cross for the top may be made of tiny rice shells. The towers
should be covered with larger sized rice shells, and on the summit
of each a small cone shell should be placed. The opening
for the watch should be surrounded by flat, round, white shells.
The inside of the case for the watch should be lined with crimson
velvet, glued in. The outside should be covered with shells.</p>

<p>Harps, guitars, etc., etc., can be ornamented in the same
way. If they are riveted into marble slabs, the trouble of
covering the stands with shells will be avoided. Cigar stands
can be made of thick card-board, but tin is better; it must
be cut about seven and a half inches long and four inches
wide, and soldered together, (to make a round cup) and fastened
upon a stand. Boxes, tables, vases, and all kinds of
ornamental articles can be covered with shells.</p>

are strung on slender wires, which are twisted or woven into
diamonds or squares, or rows as you fancy, and then formed
into baskets. A gold band between every two berries gives
a lively look to the basket. Around the top are sometimes
twisted semi-circles of berries, from which are suspended festoons
of berries strung on silk, drooping over the outside.</p>

<p>The baskets may be lined with bright colored silk and ornamented
with ribbons. Baskets can be made of cloves in
the same way, by taking off the berry and soaking the long
part in spirit. Bead baskets are also made in the same way;
the wire should be the color of the bead. Cut glass beads
are the most desirable, as they glitter prettily amidst the green
boughs of the Christmas tree.</p>

one for the ground work; cut another in halves; wet the
edges of one of the halves and stick it upright through the
middle of the whole one; cut the other half into two quarters,
wet the two straight sides, and place them on each side of the
half wafer; this forms a kind of rosette. When you have
enough prepared, wet the bottoms of the whole wafers, and
fasten them on the basket in such forms as you please. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
is very pretty to have the whole wafer one color and the
rosette another. Stars can be made by placing six quarter
wafers around the half in place of two. The handle can be
decorated in the same manner, or with ribbons. Care must
be taken to have the wafers cut even and uniform.</p>

feathery substance will adhere to it; then lay a piece of
white paper upon the top of the gummed paper, and rub it
gently with your finger, or the smooth handle of a knife. A
perfect impression of the wings will thus be taken. The
body must be drawn and painted in the space between the
wings.</p>

a green leaf upon the black surface, and let it remain pressed

white paper and press it in a book, with something heavy
upon the top of it. When taken out, one of the papers will
have received a perfect impression of the leaf with all its

Paste these pieces on a sheet of paper, in the same relative
positions they occupy in the landscape; if the shade be rather
light, put on only one thickness of paper; if darker, two
thicknesses and three thicknesses may be used; if the shadow
is very deep and heavy, five or six pieces may be pasted on,
one above another. When held up to the light, shades are
produced differing in degree according to the thickness of the
paper. These make very pretty transparencies for lamps in
Summer. Lamp shades can be made in this way with colored
paper placed between two thin white papers and so arranged
that the shadows will represent grapes, or any fruit or flower.
China lamp shades are prepared in the same way, that is, portions
of the china are made thicker than others; in the daylight
they appear perfectly white, but when the light shines
through them the shades look like a soft landscape in India
ink. It is on the same principle that the beautiful Parian
transparencies are made for windows.</p>

<p class="dc13">THE ÆOLIAN HARP consists of an oblong
box of thin deal board about five or six
inches deep, with a circle drawn in the middle
of the upper side, an inch and a half in
diameter, around which are to be drilled
small holes. Along the upper side of the
box seven, ten or more small strings of very
fine gut are stretched over bridges near each
end, like the bridges of a violin, and tightened
or relaxed with screw pins. The strings must be tuned
to one and the same note, and the instrument placed in some
current of air where the wind can pass over its strings
with freedom. A window, the width of which is exactly
equal to the length of the harp, with the sash just raised to
give the air admission, is a good situation. When the wind
blows upon the strings, with various degrees of force, different
musical tones will be sounded; sometimes the blast
brings out all the tones in full concert, and sometimes it
sinks them to the softest murmur. In many old castles these
harps were fastened in the windows, and their wild music
caused the ignorant to think they were haunted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>A colossal imitation of the instrument just described was
invented at Milan, in 1786, by Abbate Gattoni. He stretched
seven strong iron wires, tuned to the notes of the gamut,
from the top of a tower sixty feet high, to the house of a
Signor Muscate, who was interested in the success of the experiment;
and this apparatus, called the giant’s harp, in
blowing weather yielded lengthened peals of harmonious
music. In a storm this music was sometimes heard at the
distance of several miles.</p>

<p>Simply tying waxed saddler’s silk to little sticks, and pushing
them into the crevices of windows, so as to receive a draft
of wind (the silk being strained tight), will produce very
sweet sounds.</p>

with some of their most complete deceptions. The imitation
of thunder in their subterranean temples did not fail to
indicate the presence of a supernatural agent. The golden
virgins, whose ravishing voices resounded through the temple
of Delphos; the stone from the river Pactoles, where trumpet
notes scared the robber from the treasure which it guarded;
the speaking head, which uttered its oracular responses at
Lesbos; and the vocal statue of Memnon, which began at
the break of day to accost the rising sun, were all deceptions
derived from science, and from a diligent observation of the
phenomena of nature.</p>

<p class="psh">A SINGULAR EXAMPLE OF SUPERSTITION.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following <i>true story</i> was related to me by one who was
personally acquainted with the facts. There was a certain
bend in one of our western rivers which was avoided by every
one, as it was supposed to be haunted by the devil. At a
certain hour in the evening, for many years, terrible curses
were distinctly heard. Suddenly they ceased. A gentleman
skilled in the science of acoustics, hearing an account of the
strange phenomena, determined to ascertain the cause, and
carefully examined the river on each side for about a mile
above and below the bend. He ascertained that at about the
time the sounds ceased, an old fisherman, who had lived on
the opposite side of the river, full a mile from the spot where
the curses were heard, had died. He was told that the fisherman
was in the habit of crossing the river to a village, where
he found a market for his fish, and where he spent his money
for liquor, and that after drinking freely on his way home,
while rowing across the river at night, he would swear terribly.
This gentleman then persuaded a friend to go down the river
to the place where the curses were formerly heard, while he
remained in a boat on the river at the point at which the old
man usually crossed. He then played on a bugle and sung
several songs. His friend soon returned, and with eager
delight exclaimed:  “Oh, &mdash;&mdash;, such glorious music fills
the air just where the curses used to be heard.” The neighbors
came rushing down to hear it, and some fell on their
knees praying; they said “the angels have driven the devil
away.” Mr. &mdash;&mdash; then asked what were the songs they
heard. His friend described them correctly, and said he
understood even the words, one of them being the famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Marseillaise, another a German song; the foreign words made
the ignorant more sure that the sounds were supernatural.
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; then played on the bugle and sang again the
same songs, while his friend stood by; but his friend said the
music was not equal to that he had heard below, where the
sounds had really seemed heavenly.</p>

<p>The peculiar configuration of the river banks had concentrated
the sounds, and the distance and the water had
softened them.</p>

<p>The person who related this anecdote to me said that he
and his friend had often tried the experiment. Nothing
would convince the more ignorant neighbors that the sounds
were occasioned by merely natural causes. A love of the
supernatural is strong within us, and sometimes leads us into
grave mistakes.</p>

<p class="psh">THEORY OF THE VOICE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Provide</span> a species of whistle common as a child’s toy, or a
sportsman’s call, in the form of a hollow cylinder, about three-fourths
of an inch in diameter, closed at both ends, by flat
circular plates with holes in their centres. Hold this toy
between the teeth and the lips; blow through it, and you can
produce sounds, varying in pitch with the force with which
you blow. If the air be cautiously graduated, all the sounds
within the compass of a double octave may be produced from
it; and, if great precaution be taken in the management of
the breath, even deeper tones may be brought out. This
simple instrument, or toy, has indeed the greatest resemblance
to the larynx, which is the organ of the voice.</p>

<p class="psh">THE VISIBLY GROWING ACORN.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cut</span> a circular piece of card to fit the top of a hyacinth
glass, so as to rest upon the ledge, and exclude the air.
Pierce a hole through the centre of the card, and pass through
it a strong thread, having a small piece of wood tied to one
end, which, resting transversely on the card, is prevented
from being drawn through. To the other end of the thread
attach an acorn; and having half filled the glass with water,
suspend the acorn at a short distance from the surface. The
glass must be kept in a warm room; and in a few days the
steam which has generated in the glass will hang from the
acorn in a large drop. Shortly afterwards the acorn will
burst, the root will protrude and thrust itself into the water;
and in a few days more a stem will shoot out at the other
end, and rising upwards, will press against the card, in which
an orifice must be made to allow it to pass through. From
this stem small leaves will soon begin to sprout; and in the
course of a few weeks you will have a handsome oak plant,
several inches in height.</p>

<p class="dc13">DANCING is the most agreeable of all indoor
pastimes that combine pleasure with
healthful exercise. It also gives grace and
elasticity to the movements. The modern
gymnasium has many of the attractions of
our dancing schools, but its exercises are often
too violent for delicate children. The dancing
school has proved physically beneficial to
many who have been sent to it as an experiment,
at an early age. Such exercise invigorates
the frame and does more for permanent health than
can be accomplished by medicine. Exercise, to be beneficial,
must have some pleasant excitement connected with it.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant sight to see a home circle, old and young,
joining in a lively quadrille, or an old fashioned contra dance,
in the early evening hour, either the mother or a daughter
presiding at the piano. How joyously even children of three
and four years old make their tiny feet move in time to merry
music. “Pop goes the Weasel” is a dance only suited to
little children, and they are apt scholars and can all join in singing
the popular tune. It may be well to give the directions
for this and a few other dances.</p>

<p class="psh">POP GOES THE WEASEL.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is an old English dance revived. The positions first
taken are the same as in the contra dance, the ladies and gentlemen
being placed in lines opposite to each other. The
couple at the top begin the figures. They first dance down
outside the lines and back, then join hands and down the
middle, then join hands with the lady of the couple next to
them and the three dance around in a circle till the music
comes to “Pop goes the Weasel.” As they sing that, the second
lady passes quickly under the joined hands of the couple
dancing, and goes to her place; the same couple then join
hands with the gentleman opposite, and at the proper time he
pops under their joined hands in like manner; then down outside,
back again and join hands and down the middle; then
take the next lady and dance around as before. So on through
the whole line. As soon as the top couple have danced down
twice, the next couple begins. If there are long lines, there
is often a number of couples dancing together, and when all
sing in time the dance is very pretty.</p>

<p class="dc13">PRIVATE theatricals and dramatic
or Shakspeare reading clubs are among the
fashionable amusements of the present day.
Many, I know, disapprove of them; but I
think they do far more good than harm.
They certainly strengthen the lungs, memory,
and improve the intellectual tastes. But I
will not discuss the subject, as far abler pens
than mine have already argued on both sides
of the question. Private theatricals amuse
a large circle of friends, and any club willing to undertake
the presentation of plays deserves the thanks of the audience.</p>

<p>Even a simple farce requires much labor and frequent
rehearsals, to be well acted, and one soon wearies of the constant
repetition of even witty sayings. The most trivial
character must be carefully studied, for one bad actor often
destroys the effect of the whole play. Then the foot-lights,
stage, &amp;c., must be prepared. A few directions, with a list
of easy farces may be of service. All who live in cities can
easily hire scenery, dresses, &amp;c., but for the benefit of towns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and villages, I will give a short account of how such things
can be managed.</p>

<p>Some lady can almost always be found who will give the
use of her house. A house should be selected which has
two parlors, connected by large folding doors, or an arch;
one parlor being for the audience, and the other for the stage.
All the furniture and carpets should be taken from the latter
room. A rough staging should be built (boards can be
easily hired), and by boring a hole in the floor a gas-pipe can
be run up along the front of the staging, with a sufficient
number of burners. Tin shades painted green (as they render
the light softer, and more agreeable to the eye) are an
addition, for they keep the light from the audience, and throw
it directly on the actors. A large floor cloth can be nailed
on the stage for a carpet. A drop curtain, so arranged as to
be rolled up quickly and easily, by means of a cord pulley
at one side of the stage, where the prompter sits, just out of
sight of the audience, is necessary. Scenery for the sides
and back parts of the stage can be roughly painted on cloth;
it answers every purpose of canvass by being strained when
wet over light wooden frames (made so as to be easily moved);
when dry, it presents a smooth, hard surface.</p>

<p>Each member should provide his or her own dress. To
give the required expressions to the faces, a box of good
water colors, some fine chalk powder, camel’s hair pencils,
and rouge saucers, are wanted. To make frowns, scowls, or
comical expressions, such as a broad grin, smirk, or simper,
stand before a mirror and assume the desired expression; then
trace the wrinkles produced, with a fine brush of the brown
tint; this will fix the required expression on your face.
Rouge is best applied with the finger. Burnt cork is excellent
for darkening eyebrows, and making moustaches, also
for representing leanness, which will be done by applying a
faint tint just under the eyes, on the sides of the cheeks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
under the lower lip. A strong mark running from the corner
of the nose down towards the corner of the mouth on each
side, marks age or emaciation.</p>

<p>A few directions may be of use in regard to the preparation
of theatrical dresses. Powdered wigs can be made of
tow, raveled yarn, or gray colored horse hair; beards and
moustache of the same, or a piece of buffalo skin. Ermine
can be made of cotton flannel with tags of lion skin cloth
sewed on, or black tags painted. Pelisse wadding is sometimes
used.</p>

<p>Crowns and sceptres are easily made of pasteboard and
gold paper. Velvet talma cloaks, capes, or even the loose
velvet sack, can be converted into cavalier cloaks (the arm-holes
in the sack must be fastened up on the inside), by fastening
them gracefully over one shoulder. Then put on a
large old-fashioned lace collar, ruffles around the hand, a Kossuth
hat, looped up on one side with a paste pin or buckle,
fastening a white or black plume, (taken from some lady’s bonnet),
stockings drawn over the pantaloons and fastened at the
knees with bows and buckles; and lo! with but little trouble,
you have a fine cavalier of the olden times. With old finery and
a little ingenuity, a theatrical wardrobe can be quickly made,
if all are willing to do their part, but the larger share of the
work is generally done by a few. Rocks can be made by
throwing plain gray blanket shawls over ottomans, tables, &amp;c.
Rain may be imitated by dropping peas in a tin pan, thunder
by rattling sheet-iron, lightning by means of a tin tube,
larger at one end than the other, and filled with powdered
resin. The smaller end of the tube should be open, the
other end so managed that the resin may sift through. Shake
the tube over a lamp, or blow the resin through a plain tube
into the flame of a lamp, and you will have a good imitation
of lightning.</p>

<p>Dissolve crystals of nitrate of copper in spirits of wine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
light the solution and it will burn with a beautiful emerald
green flame. Pieces of sponge, soaked in this spirit, lighted
and suspended by fine wires over the stage of theatres, produce
the lambent green flames, now so common in incantation
scenes. Strips of flannel saturated with it, and wrapped
around pieces of copper, will form the swords and fire-forks
brandished by the demons in such scenes. Devices like the
above are very simple, and add much to the general effect.</p>

<p class="psh">DRAMATIC READING CLUBS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> clubs are far more agreeable to their members and
less likely to cause unpleasant rivalries, which, it is to be regretted,
are apt to arise among even private actors. Human
nature, alas, is weak! Some clubs read Shakspeare alone. It
is most certainly a noble study, and one we can never weary
of. Few can hope ever to excel in delineating Shakspeare.
Therefore it is well, if we meet together for social enjoyment
as well as improvement, to have a variety of plays. I have
known of very successful clubs, and I will give the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
manner of proceeding adopted by one of them, as it may assist
in the formation of others. The club was started by
some young ladies with a view of making home and winter
evenings agreeable to their brothers; a committee was chosen
to form a code of laws. Each one was to subscribe a small
sum to purchase the “librettos” of their plays. The following
rules were signed by all the members:</p>

<p>1.  Each member of the club must take his or her turn in
choosing a play, and in giving out the rôle of characters.</p>

<p>2.  Every member must take the characters given him,
and do his best, unless he can exchange parts with some other
member, with the consent of the one who selected the play.</p>

<p>3.  The one who selects the play has a right to the best
character.</p>

<p>4.  The club shall meet once a week at the houses of
members, in alphabetical rotation.</p>

<p>5.  Whenever any member is unable to take his part and
cannot attend the meeting, he must provide some one to take
his character.</p>

<p>6.  No new member can be admitted without the vote of
the majority.</p>

<p>7.  Each member must study his or her part well, before
meeting with the club. If any two, or several, should have
difficult parts together, they must meet privately and practise
them.</p>

<p>At first, they merely read the plays; but soon, they partially
acted them, and found them increased in interest thereby.
They always had their little librettos by them. Those
who had ready memories rarely referred to them; or a mere
glance would be sufficient. Finally they dressed in character,
and admitted an audience composed of their relatives.</p>

<p>There is not necessarily anything awkward in having the
books in hand. Such little pamphlets can be easily rolled up,
and will scarcely be noticed. Under these rules they became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
familiar with the best plays, without wearying of them; and
each member had an opportunity of consulting his own taste.</p>

<p>I sincerely recommend this as an amusement. Persons
who read French and German will find this an admirable way
of learning to converse with ease in either of those languages.</p>

<p>Sheridan Knowles’ plays and Shakspeare are among the
best to select from. “Love’s Sacrifice,” “Ion,” “Hunchback,”
and “William Tell,” are excellent plays to be read
in this way.</p>

<p class="psh">CHARADES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no game that can afford so much amusement to a
circle of friends as that of acting charades. It affords a
scope for the exercise of both wit and ingenuity.</p>

<p>A word must be chosen, in which the syllables may be rendered
into some kind of a lively performance, and the whole
word must be capable of similar representation. Then the
plan of action must be agreed upon. Old-fashioned garments,
gay shawls, scarfs, old coats, hats, aprons, gowns,
&amp;c., must be looked up for the occasion, and speedily converted
into various and grotesque costumes, suited to the
representation to be made. By exercising a little ingenuity,
very fine charades can be acted “impromptu.” Speed, in
all preparations, is quite necessary to success, as an audience
is always impatient. If it is determined to have charades at
a party, the lady of the house should arrange dresses, plan of
action and subjects, beforehand. She can generally tell who
can assist her best. If all the arrangements can be made
without the knowledge of her guests, the effect will be greatly
increased. This is also an improving game for a family of
children. Write the plot and a simple dialogue, and let them
learn it; it will be a good exercise for the memory, and teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
them ease of manner; but let them only act before a home
circle.</p>

<p>A few directions for acting certain words, and a short list
of words easy to be acted may be of service to my readers.
If a word or syllable can be represented by action, it should
be seldom spoken, but syllables must be spoken in some cases
to give an idea of the word:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Penitent.</span>&mdash;“Penny” sufficiently expresses the first division
of the word. It can be represented by dressing in old
clothes, torn hats, bonnets, &amp;c., to appear as street hawkers,
common in cities. One can sell “Lucifer matches&mdash;penny a
bunch!” another, “Apples, fine red apples&mdash;penny apiece!”
another, “Oranges, fine fresh oranges&mdash;penny apiece!” and
so on. In this way a motley group can be contrived. A
policeman, rushing in and dispersing the group, may close
the scene. “Tent” can be represented by throwing a sheet
or table-cloth over two chairs (high-backed chairs would be
preferable), in the style of a gypsy tent. In front should be
grouped some gypsies, in gay shawls, handkerchiefs, looped
dresses, &amp;c. A lady and gentleman can approach and ask
to have their fortunes told, &amp;c. Some one of the gypsies
singing, “In the days when we went gypsying,” would close
this act well. “Penitent” can be easily represented in a
variety of ways. If it is not guessed, the charade could be
repeated and acted differently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridewell.</span>&mdash;“Bride” is usually represented by a wedding,
which can be arranged to suit the tastes of the parties
acting, and can be either simple or elaborate, as they may
please. The common way is to have a dress ceremony; bride
in full costume, with bridesmaids, but for a change, one might
arrange a justice’s office, and have a couple come in to be
married, the bride conspicuous in white bows and ends, and
cheap finery. Let her be the chief speaker, the man appearing
awkward and shy. After the ceremony, let her drive a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
sharp bargain in paying the fee. “Well:” Take a large
tub and cover it with a gray shawl, so arranged as to look
like stone, and if you have any green fleecy mats, arrange
them to represent grass. A dark-complexioned gentleman,
(any one can stain his face for the occasion,) with a turban,
and dressed in shawls skillfully arranged, may represent an
Eastern Emir. He should be seen seated Turkish-fashion by
the well. A lady, dressed as Rebecca, with a crimson scarf
about her waist, having her arms bare, and a handkerchief
bound around her head, should come in, holding with one arm
a pitcher on her head. Let her seem to fill her pitcher at the
well. Then Eliezer must ask her to give him drink. After
she has handed him her pitcher (which she must have placed
on her head after having appeared to fill it), he must take
from his bosom a casket of jewels, and exhibit bracelets and
ear-rings. She can feign astonishment and admiration. He
must kneel at her feet and present them. She should express
surprise and delight. Then Eliezer must fasten on the bracelets,
and the scene of Eliezer and Rebecca at the <i>well</i> will be
represented.</p>

<p>To act “Bridewell:” Arrange a prison cell; take screens
or clothes-frames, and hang them with gray or black shawls,
and cover the carpet. Put in a common wood table and a
kitchen chair, and let a dim-lighted lantern be the only light.
Some gentleman, meanly clad, with hair all on end; and
clenched hands resting on his knees, must be seated in the
chair, with eyes bent sullenly on the ground, and with a
scowling brow. Let chains hang from his wrists and ankles,
and as he moves clank together. Acted in this way, the
word would be easily guessed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farewell.</span>&mdash;“Fare:” A gentleman dressed as a hackman
can come in, whip in hand. Then a gentleman and lady
and a child should appear, dressed for a journey. The hackman
must address them in the usual manner, offering to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
them to any place, &amp;c. The gentleman must then ask,
“What is the <i>fare</i>?” and bargains for it, refusing to pay
<i>fare</i> for the child, &amp;c.  “Well:” Two ladies enter with
shawls and bonnets on, and appear to meet accidentally;
each asks anxiously if the other is <i>well</i>, and if all the family
are <i>well</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“Farewell” can be acted in various ways. A party with
bandboxes and baskets, on their way west, may be bidding
<i>farewell</i> to friends; or a lover, going to California, may be
taking leave of his lady-love, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Railway.</span>&mdash;“Rail:” Take two chairs, and place a strong
cane, stick or broom, with one end resting on each chair. Then
some boy or girl may come in and jump on the stick, swing
over it, and talk about “riding on a <i>rail</i>.” An elderly lady
or gentleman should come in and talk to him about breaking his
neck on the rail, &amp;c., &amp;c.  “Way:” a gentleman with a carpet
bag in his hand may inquire the <i>way</i> to the depot, or an
old lady may ask which is the <i>way</i> to the menagerie, &amp;c.
“Railway:” Let a party of people come rushing in, some
limping and groaning, others wondering where their bandboxes
have gone to! all talking of the “smash up” on the
<i>railway</i>, bringing in the word in all possible ways.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carpet.</span>&mdash;“Car:” several persons may pass in and out
dressed in character, as a Yankee peddler, a country girl
never before from home, a man of business, a fine lady with
servants, &amp;c., all appearing to be waiting for the <i>cars</i>, and
talking about them. Suddenly let a bell ring, and the conductor
call out, “Cars start for,” etc. All then rush forward
in character. “Pet:” Let a lady come in with a cat, dog
or any <i>pet</i> animal, fondling it as absurdly as possible, pretending
it is sick, calling for some one to go for the doctor, &amp;c.
“Carpet:” Arrange a table as a counter. Some one must
act as shopman. Let a lady enter with a simpering air, her
intended husband following, and ask to look at <i>carpets</i>. Have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
in readiness under the counter several pieces of <i>carpets</i> or
rugs, which the shopman should display, while the lady consults
the taste of her future lord, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lunatic.</span>&mdash;“Luna:” A gentleman, dressed as a young
collegian, enters with a young lady on his arm; they pretend
to be walking by <i>moon</i>-light. He speaks of the moon by its
latin name, <i>Luna</i>, and talks in a high-flown style. The lady
may ask in a flat and awkward style, “Who is Luna?” saying
she never heard of her, &amp;c., &amp;c. The young man explains,
in a bombastic style, who <i>Luna</i> is. “Tic:” A
lady represents an old woman, and goes about offering to
make over old <i>tics</i>, as good as new, and also says she has
some geese feathers to sell, carrying on of course other conversation,
so that the word to be guessed may not be too apparent.
“Lunatic:” The best actor of the company feigns
the part of a <i>lunatic</i>, in any way he sees fit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamentable.</span>&mdash;(French charade.) “L’amont” can be
acted well in pantomime, by representing an old deaf man,
and his young wife; the old man with spectacles on nose,
sitting in a large chair, reading the newspaper, his young
wife standing behind the chair. A low tap is heard at the
door. She starts and listens; the door opens slily and discovers
a young man. She starts with delight, but points to
the old man, motioning the young man to go. He makes
gestures of despair; then appears to have a sudden thought,
bows and retires. Soon a loud knock is heard, she goes to
the door, and returns with a letter, giving it to the old man;
he reads, shakes his head, and hands it to her; she looks at
it, runs for his hat and coat and motions him to go. He
leaves at one door, while <i>L’Aman</i> enters at another. Then
they act a lover like scene and the curtain drops. “Table:”
She again appears with sleeves rolled up, apron on, rolling-pin
in hand, making cakes; the young lover standing by, and
now and then eating one of the cakes. They hear a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
step and the lover runs for a hiding-place. At last he springs
under the table, and she pulls a table-cloth down around it,
and goes on rolling cakes. In comes the old man, hobbling
along. He looks around and suspects something, and begins
a strict search. Thus ends that scene. “Lamentable:”
The same actors appear, but the table is turned over, and behold!
the old man has seized the young lover, and is brandishing
aloft a heavy cane, while the young wife appears, weeping
bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warlock.</span>&mdash;(A male wizard.) “War:” A wounded
soldier is seen prostrate and dying. “Lock:” An old woman
with a long tow wig, sits mumbling to herself, and knitting.
A young man appears and pretends entire devotion to
her, and begs for a <i>lock</i> of her hair. She refuses at first, but
he coaxes it from her. She then takes out a large pair of
shears and cuts off a long <i>lock</i>, rolls it up and gives it to him.
He pretends ecstasy, but laughs behind her back. “Warlock:”
A gentleman dressed as an old wizard, appears and
offers to tell fortunes, &amp;c.; this can be performed as the actor
thinks best.</p>

<p>The following words are easy to be acted:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh">TABLEAUX VIVANTS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tableau</span> vivants, as commonly represented, are so well understood
that no directions are necessary, but some of my
readers may not have heard of the illustration of poems, &amp;c.,
by a series of living pictures. This is far more interesting
than simply to personify some one picture. Still another way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
is to represent the different scenes in a song, while at the
same time some one who is a good musician sings the verses
of the song as they are represented. For instance, “The
Mistletoe Bough,” first represent a room decorated with green,
a company assembled gaily dressed and dancing, while a lady
or gentleman behind the scene sings the verse represented in
distinct tones, and so on through the whole song; the last
scene representing children in a lumber-room opening an old
chest and exposing a skeleton, old flowers, &amp;c. “Auld
Robin Grey,” and “The Three Fishers” are easily represented.
Still another variety of tableaux is a song represented
in pantomime, for instance, the song of “Blue Beard,”
or “O, they Marched through the Town,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class="dc13">FORTUNE telling, as a practice, is morally
wrong, and they who intentionally deceive
credulous people commit a sin; the effects
of such deception on sensitive minds are often
lasting, and in some instances have been attended
with very sad results. Almost all persons
have a little superstition in their natures,
and naturally relish mystery.</p>

<p>But as a game and pastime, fortune telling
is harmless and amusing. The old fashioned fate lady has
afforded much amusement and profit at fairs. The following
is a more modern and graceful method: Cut green enameled
paper in the shape of oak leaves, and on the white side
write some simple oracle. The person who represents the
sibyl seats herself, dressed in character, under a tasteful canopy,
with a table in front, and her sibylline leaves scattered
over it, with the green side upwards. Then as individuals
enquire their fate of the oracle, let her move about the leaves,
muttering some incantation, and let each one select his or her
own leaf. Another way is to hold the leaves in a cornucopia
and scatter them around from it. Care must be taken not to
expose the white side of the leaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Procure</span> a quantity of cards, each with a separate flower
painted upon it. In a book write the meaning of each
flower, and then let a person choose any number of cards.
You must look out the meaning of each, and ingeniously
combine the whole into one sentence. A more beautiful design
for a fair or a social party is the arrangement of natural
flowers in small fate bouquets, some one person arranging
their accompanying oracles beforehand. Then let the person
seeking to know his fate select a bouquet.</p>

heavy storm, found he had provisions sufficient for only half his
crew, and decided to throw overboard half of them, to be selected
by lot. There were twenty men, half of them white,
and half black; he placed them all in a circle, saying that
every fifth man in three times round should be thrown overboard.
He appeared to arrange them carelessly, yet he managed
so that the lot fell to the ten black men. How could it be?</p>

<p>2. <i>The Wolf, the Goat and the Cabbages.</i>&mdash;Suppose a
man has a wolf, a goat, and a basket of cabbages, on the bank
of a river; he wishes to cross with them, but his boat can only
hold one of the three beside himself. He must therefore take
them over one by one, in such a manner that the wolf shall
have no opportunity to devour the goat, nor the goat the cabbages.
How is he to accomplish it?</p>

<p>3. <i>The impossibility made possible.</i>&mdash;Place three pieces
of money on the table and desire some person to take away
the piece from the centre without touching it.</p>

could eat the greatest number. One eat ninety-nine only, the

<p>1.  An old man married a young woman; their united
ages amounted to one hundred. The man’s age, multiplied
by four and divided by nine, gives the woman’s age. What
were their respective ages?</p>

<p>2.  How many yards of paper, three-quarters of a yard
wide, will cover a chamber that is sixty feet round, and ten
feet one and one-half inches high?</p>

<p>3.  In a family of eight young people, it was agreed that
three at a time should visit the Crystal Palace, and that the
visit should be repeated each day as long as a different trio
could be selected. In how many days were the possible combinations
of three out of eight completed?</p>

<p>4.  How many changes can be given to seven notes of a
piano? That is to say, in how many ways can seven keys be
struck in succession, so that there shall be some difference in
the order of the notes each time?</p>

<p>5.  At a time when eggs were scarce, an old woman who
possessed some good hens, wishing to oblige her friends, sent
her daughter with a basket of eggs to three of them; at the
first house, which was the squire’s, she left half the number
of eggs she had, and half a one over; at the second she left
half of what remained and half an egg over; and at the third
she again left half of the remainder, and half a one over; she
carried home one egg in her basket, not having broken any.
How many had she when she started?</p>

<p>6.  Two drovers, A and B, meeting on the road, began
discoursing about the number of sheep they each had. Says
B to A, “Pray give me one of your sheep and I will have
as many as you.” “Nay,” replied A, “but give me one
of your sheep and I will have as many again as you.” Required
to know the number of sheep they each had?</p>

person set the hand of the dial of a watch at any hour he
pleases, and tell you what that hour is; and to the number
of that hour you add in your mind twelve; then tell him to
count privately the number of that amount upon the dial, beginning
with the next hour to that on which he proposes to
rise, and counting backwards, first reckoning the number of
the hour at which he has placed the hand. How is it done?</p>

<p class="psh">ANSWERS TO PARADOXES AND
PUZZLES.</p>

<p>1.  The secret of the puzzle is to arrange the men by a
simple formula; take the sentence, “A gray owl did eat a
snake,” and arrange them with checkers, the vowels all black,
the consonants white. You will then see by taking away
every fifth one, three times round, those left will be all white.</p>

<p>2.  First take over the goat, the next time the wolf; leaving
the wolf he must bring back the goat and leave it, then
take the cabbages, and going back once more he takes the
goat. Thus the wolf will never be left with the goat, nor the
goat with the cabbages.</p>

<p>3.  If the secret be not discovered, remove one of the end
pieces to the other side, thus you take away the piece from the
centre without touching it.</p>

<p>6.  A had seven and B had five sheep.</p>

<p>7.  Suppose the hour he intends to rise be 8, and that he
has placed the hand at 5; you will add 12 to 5 and tell him
to count 17 on the dial first reckoning 5, the hour at which
the index stands, and counting backwards from the hour at
which he intends to rise; and the number, 17, will necessarily
end at 8, which shows that to be the hour he chose to rise.</p>

<p>8.  The five-gallon barrel was filled first, and from that the
three-gallon barrel, thus leaving two gallons in the five-gallon
barrel; the three-gallon barrel was then emptied into the
eight-gallon barrel, and the two gallons poured from the five-gallon
barrel into the empty three-gallon barrel; the five-gallon
barrel was then filled, and one gallon poured into the
three-gallon barrel, therefore leaving four gallons in the five-gallon
barrel, one gallon in the eight-gallon barrel, and three
gallons in the three-gallon barrel, which was then emptied into
the eight-gallon barrel. Thus each person had four gallons
of brandy in the eight and five-gallon barrels respectively.</p>

<p class="dc13">BLIND MAN’S BUFF is a popular, old-fashioned
and delightful pastime, too well
known to render any description of it necessary.
A more quiet variety of blind man’s
buff is played in the following manner:  All
the company arrange themselves around the
room, one being blinded in the centre. Some
one then either numbers them, or calls them
by the names of different towns or cities.
Each one must remember the name given him.
Then the one who named them calls out to any two in the
party, such as:  “Two and Ten change places,” or, “Boston
go to New York,” &amp;c. Those called must quickly exchange
places (on pain of a forfeit it they do not), the one
blinded trying to catch them on their way. The caller must
make them change places often, and from distant sides of the
room, so as to give the blinder a good chance. If he catches
any one in the act of changing his place, and calls his name
correctly, the person so caught must take the part of blind-man
until, in turn, he catches somebody else.</p>

<p class="psh">SHADOW BUFF.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shadow</span> Buff is a variation of blind man’s buff. Though
not as generally known, it is equally amusing. A large
piece of white cloth, or a linen or cotton sheet, is suspended
smoothly at one end of the room, at a little distance from
“Buffy,” who sits with his face towards the cloth, and his
back to the company. Behind him a light must be so placed
as to throw the shadows of persons passing between it and
“Buffy” directly on the curtain. All other lights must be
extinguished. The players then walk, one by one, slowly
between the light and “Buffy” (who must not turn his
head), limping, jumping, grimacing, or disguised as they
please, so as to distort their shadows on the curtain. If
“Buffy” can tell correctly to whom any shadow belongs
(guessing once only at each person), the player whom he
so discovers takes his place as “Buffy.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="psh">BLIND MAN’S WAND.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is another variety of the same game. The blind
man carries a cane, which he reaches in every direction.
Whoever it touches is bound, by the rules of the game, to
take hold of it, and repeat whatever the blind man orders.
The one who is caught can disguise his voice as he pleases.
The blind man is allowed three guesses, and if he cannot discover
the person touched by his voice, he must try another.
This is an amusing change.</p>

<p>There is still another, called “Fettered Buff.” The person
who is to catch his companions is not blinded, but his
wrists are tied behind him, and he catches by running backwards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
This form of the game is not recommended. The
person so bound cannot balance himself easily, or guard himself,
and is liable to injury from falling.</p>

<p class="psh">CHINESE SHADOWS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> can be played only in the evening, by candle light.
A white curtain should be fastened smoothly at one end of
the room, as in “shadow buff.” Half the company must be
spectators and half actors. The spectators must be seated
facing the curtain. Two persons in front should hold a ribbon
or stick across the curtain as high as they can easily
reach, to mark the line on which the shadows are to move, or
a line may be drawn across the curtain. The actors must
stand behind the spectators, at a little distance, with a large
supply of figures cut in paper, such as houses, trees, men,
women, animals, birds, &amp;c. These figures must be slowly
passed along, one after the other, in the manner you wish the
shadows to fall on the curtain. It is easy to make them advance,
retreat, &amp;c., while you hold conversation for them.
Those who are skillful in the use of these shadows, can make
them represent a battle, game, contra dance, &amp;c. The figures
of inanimate things must not be moved; birds can be
suspended on the ends of strings, and swung about irregularly,
from time to time. The effect is not unlike a magic
lantern. When the actors have played long enough, they
must change places with the spectators.</p>

<p class="psh">“THE COMICAL CONCERT.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> game, when well played, is extremely diverting.
The players are arranged as an orchestra, and each one undertakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to imitate some musical instrument. One pretends
to play the violin, by stretching out her left arm, and moving
her right hand across it, as if she were drawing a bow;
another doubles up her hands and puts them to her mouth,
to imitate a horn; another moves her fingers on a table, to
imitate a piano; another takes the back of a chair and touches
the rounds, as if they were the strings of a harp; another
motions as if beating a drum; another holds a stick, after
the manner of a guitar, and pretends to play upon it; another
appears to be turning a hand-organ; another plays a flute,
trombone, or any instrument he fancies&mdash;even a jewsharp.
This is but half the game. Each musician should, while
playing, make a sound with his mouth, in imitation of his
instrument, thus:</p>

<p class="pp8 p1">Rub-a-dub, goes the drum;<br />
Twang, twang, goes the harp<br />
Toot, too, hoo, goes the horn;<br />
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dee, goes the violin, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="p1">If all play with spirit it makes a laughable jumble. The
leader must stand facing the orchestra, with a long stick,
beating time, in an absurd imitation of some famous leader.
In the midst of the noise and fun, he suddenly stops, and
pointing his wand of office to one of the players, asks, abruptly,
“Why don’t you play better?” The one spoken to
must answer instantly, and with suitable reference to the
nature of his instrument. For instance, the drummer could
say one of his drumsticks is broken; the harper, that a
string is loose; the pianist, that a key is broken or out of
tune; the violinist, that a string is broken, &amp;c. If they
hesitate a moment, or give an unsuitable answer, or if they
repeat an excuse already made, they must pay a forfeit or
take a new instrument. While one is answering, all must
stop playing. When the leader waves aloft his wand, all
must commence again, and play till he speaks to some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
else; so on till they are weary. Sometimes it is a rule that all
who laugh must pay a forfeit. There are many forfeits in
that case.</p>

<p class="psh">THE MENAGERIE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a noisy game. All the actors in the play must
take seats around the room, while some one or two of the
number must be chosen to give out the parts. The persons
so chosen whisper in the ear of each one the name of some
animal he is to imitate. When all are ready and the signal is
given by one chosen for the purpose, each one commences
to utter sounds in imitation of the animal named to him.
Those who fail must pay some penalty. It cannot be called
a “concord of sweet sounds,” but such a game will give life
to a too quiet company on a stormy Winter evening.</p>

</div>

<p class="psh">QUAKER MEETING.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who join the game take seats around the room, and
one or more whispers in the ear of each one some witty or absurd
thing for him to do. All must be quiet who are not
playing. When all are ready, one person claps his hands,
and the first one must proceed to do what he was told; the
others must not speak or laugh, on penalty of a forfeit. Each
one in turn must act his or her part. It must all be in pantomime.
When all are through, each person must turn and
shake hands with his or her neighbor, saying: “Friend, how
dost thee do?” It is important in this game that the one
who gives the parts should be full of humor and of quick perceptions,
so as to adapt the game to the persons playing. The
parts assigned may be of endless variety. One person may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
be ordered to play a mock bravura on a table for a piano;
another to gaze in admiration of himself in a mirror and arrange
his dress and hair; another to act the scornful belle,
while a gentleman acts the urgent but despairing lover; one
to dance a hornpipe, another to make a speech by gestures,
another to make grimaces in the face of every one in the company,
another to pretend terror and fright from some imaginary
animal, etc.</p>

<p class="psh">RESEMBLANCES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the company taking part in this amusement rises,
and addressing his or her neighbor, proposes the following
question: “What does my thought resemble?” The person
interrogated replies as he or she pleases; then the questioner
adds: “In what way does the object you designate resemble
that which I am thinking of?” If, as frequently occurs,
there exists no affinity, no resemblance between the two, a
pawn must be given by the person interrogated. Here is an
example:</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i>&mdash;Tell me, Alice, what does my thought resemble?</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i>&mdash;A windmill.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i>&mdash;I thought of Rogers’ poetry; what resemblance is
there between his poems and a windmill?</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i>&mdash;I can give an answer very readily; perhaps the
very prettiest little poem written by your poet begins, “Mine
be a cot beside the mill.”</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i>&mdash;That is right; it is now your turn, Annie. What
does my thought resemble?</p>

<p><i>Annie.</i>&mdash;A chandelier.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i>&mdash;I thought of a partridge; how does a partridge resemble
a chandelier?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Annie.</i>&mdash;Dear me, I’m sure I cannot tell! I will give you
my pawn.</p>

<p>This play, by the strange inconsistencies which it authorizes,
exercises the imagination, and brings into play a good
deal of wit.</p>

<p class="psh">PUT IN A WORD.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> one in the company leaves the room, while those remaining
select a word, and then send for the person to return.
She must ask some question of the person nearest to her, to
which the one spoken to must make a prompt answer, and in
answering he must make use of the word selected. Sometimes
an acute person will guess the word from the answer
given to her first question. Some awkward use or slight
emphasis may betray it, but generally she will go to a number
and sometimes to all present without guessing the word. In
that case (unless some one volunteers to take her place), she
must go out again. If she discovers the word, the one by
whose answer she guessed it, leaves the room, and those remaining
choose a word and the game proceeds as before.</p>

</div>

<p class="psh">PROVERBS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> company select some one to leave the room; those remaining
agree upon a proverb, such as “All is not gold that
glitters,” and then send for the person to return to the room.
She must ask questions of the company in turn. The first
person asked must include in his answer the first word of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
proverb, “all,” the next person, “is,” and so on till they
complete the proverb; if she has not guessed it, and there
are more in the company, the next person begins the proverb
anew. The one by whose answer the proverb is guessed must
then leave the room. This game requires considerable ingenuity
and readiness. The proverbs selected should be familiar
ones, such as “Make hay while the sun shines,”
“When poverty comes in at the door love flies out at the
window,” “A fool is wise in his own conceit,” “A stitch in
time saves nine,” “Never look a gift horse in the mouth,”
“All’s well that ends well,” “A bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush.”</p>

<p class="psh">GAME OF CHARACTERS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A person</span> chosen leaves the room. Those remaining select
some familiar character either in history or of the present day,
for the absent one to personate. When he returns, the person
nearest him addresses him by a question, as if he were
the character selected. In like manner, each person in the
company in turn asks a question. The one at whose questions
he guesses the character must take his place and leave
the room in turn. For instance, “Napoleon the present emperor
of France” is selected. When the person returns, the
first questioner exclaims, “Are you not in constant fear of
being killed?” The next, “Are you really happy?” The
third, “Why are you so despotic?” The fourth, “Do you
believe in fatalism?” Fifth, “Do you worship the memory
of your uncle?” “Why do you not like us Americans?”
etc., etc. This play is often very amusing and tact is required
to ask questions that apply to the character and are
not too plain.</p>

<p class="psh">LAWYER.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> who take part in the play assemble and choose a lawyer.
The chairs in the room are arranged in two rows, as in
a contra dance. If there are an equal number of gentlemen
and ladies, the former choose their partners. The gentlemen
take seats opposite the ladies. The lawyer proceeds
to ask such questions as he chooses. The person addressed
must never answer, but his partner must answer for him. If
either make a mistake, he or she must change places with the
lawyer, and ask the questions. If the lawyer is ready in
asking questions, turning quickly from one person to another,
he can very soon catch some one.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p class="psh">CONSEQUENCES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a quiet game. All assemble around a table. Each
person must have a half sheet of note paper and a pencil.
All are requested to write an adjective expressing either a
good or bad quality in a man’s character. Each one then
turns over and creases down the place written upon, and all
change papers. Each one then writes a gentleman’s name, and
turns it down, and all change papers again. Then another
word of quality applying to a lady, is written, and all the
papers are turned down and changed as before. Then a
lady’s name is written. Then a place where they met; then
what he said to her; then what she said to him; what he
gave to her; and what she gave to him; then the “consequences.”
The paper must be turned down every time and
changed, and no one must read what the others have written.
When all are finished, some person collects and reads the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
papers. Some are absurd, and others happen very correctly.
For instance, they might read thus:  “The clumsy Mr.
Snooks met the beautiful Miss Primrose at a ball. He asked
her if she liked turnips; she sighed and hung her head, and
said, ‘If mamma is willing.’ He gave her a bouquet; she
gave him a box on the ear. The consequences were too sad
to relate.” A party of merry girls and boys will like this
game for a variety.</p>

<p class="psh">FOX AND GEESE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> game is a very old one, but it is too good not to be
always remembered. Arrange the company in this form, all
facing inward:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>The stars represent persons; the one outside the circle, but
next to it, is the goose; the one most distant from the circle,
the fox. When the game commences, the goose starts and
places himself or herself in front of one of the two stars.
Then the outside one becomes the goose, and the object of the
fox is to touch the outside one of three; if he succeeds, they
change places, and the one caught becomes the fox. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
one must be on the alert, and change as quickly as possible.
I have seen this game, on a stormy day at the seashore, played
with great zeal by old gentlemen, judges, lawyers, ministers,
mothers, fathers and children. One gray-haired gentleman
was the fleetest fox of all; no one could escape him, and his
laugh made all hearts glad. Green old age is beautiful to see,
and the youthful are always made happier by its genial
sympathy.</p>

<p class="psh">STAGE-COACH.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> who join this game should be seated, with the exception
of the story-teller. If there are vacant chairs, they
should either be turned over or taken out of the room. A
person with a quick memory and a flow of words, should be
selected for the office of story-teller. When all are seated,
he or she passes around the circle, giving a name to each
individual. When the story is told, the one whose name is
mentioned must rise and whirl around. When “stage-coach”
is mentioned, all must rise and turn around; when it is said
the “stage-coach tips over,” all must change places, and the
story-teller then takes his chance to secure a seat, and the one
who is left without any seat must go on with the story&mdash;the
former story-teller taking the name of the person who takes
his place. If any one fails to turn around or change places
according to the rules of the game, a forfeit must be paid.
The common way of telling the story is to describe the “Fidget
family, on a journey in a stage-coach.” The following
names are generally given to the company: Mr. and Mrs.
Fidget, the baby and nurse, Miss Fidget and Master Fidget,
and maiden aunt; gingerbread, band-box, trunks, bundles,
off horse, nigh horse, driver, whip, reins, driver’s seat, cushions,
door, curtains, wheels, footman, &amp;c. You must adapt
your names to the number playing. In telling the story, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
makes more fun to keep one or two (who will bear the joke)
constantly whirling. The story and names are at the will of
the story-teller.</p>

<p class="psh">HUNT THE FOX.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> partners, and stand as in a contra dance. The lady
at the head is the fox; her partner the hunter. At a signal,
she starts and runs down the line, her partner following; she
can pass through the lines as she pleases, the players standing
far enough apart to allow her to pass easily. The hunter
must follow the exact course of the fox; if he varies, he
must pay a forfeit. When the fox is caught, the first couple
goes to the foot, and the next couple goes through with the
same. This and “Follow the Leader” are favorite games
for Thanksgiving evenings. Old and young join.</p>

<p class="psh">SNEEZING.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> who join this game assemble in a circle. The leader
gives one of these syllables, “Ash-ish-osh,” to each one.
Thus, to the first person, “Ash;” the second, “ish;” third,
“osh;” fourth, “ash,” and so on through all the company.
The leader must then stand in the centre and count four,
slowly. When he pronounces four, all must sound their
syllables at once. The effect is very amusing; it sounds like
a prolonged sneeze.</p>

<p class="psh">THE READY WRITER.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> game can be played by any number of persons, each
one having a pencil and paper. The leader of the game
gives to each one (or each player chooses) a letter in the
alphabet. Each player then writes a sentence of five, six or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
seven words, each word commencing with the letter given
him. When all have finished, each one in turn reads his
sentence. If any one fails, he or she must recite some poetry
and pay a forfeit. This game often produces most amusing
and instructive effects. Sometimes the leader requires each
player to go through the alphabet, as follows:</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Avoid avarice, as an asp.<br />
Britons! be bold! be brave!<br />
Constant crime causes careless consciences.<br />
Do defer doing dirty deeds.<br />

<p class="psh">RHYMING WORDS IN PANTOMIME.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> who desire to join in this charming pastime must be
seated in a circle, in order that each player can have a clear
view of all the other players. One of the company must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
selected to commence the game. He must think of some word
which can be easily rhymed by other words, and give out only
the termination of the word to the other players, saying “I
have thought of a word that rhymes with &mdash;&mdash;, can any of
you guess it?” The players must next speak in answer to
the leader’s question, but whoever thinks of a word to rhyme
with the given termination must strive to act out the word he
thinks of in pantomime, as plainly as possible, and the leader
must closely watch the player who is acting the word, and as
soon as he guesses what the person acting is trying to represent,
if it is not the word selected, he must say, “It is not
&mdash;&mdash;,” (calling out the word represented) “that I thought
of,” and so on as each player acts out a word, the leader must
call out the word represented until the right word is acted.
The leader must then resign his place, and the person who
acted out the right word must be the leader and think of a
word, giving out the termination to be rhymed with. An example
will here be given to assist those ignorant of this game.</p>

<p>Suppose the person who first selects a word chooses “sting”
and gives out “ing” to be rhymed with. One of the players
makes a motion with his hands of ringing a bell. The leader
says, “It is not ring, to ring a bell.” Another player will
by signs indicate a ring on the finger. The leader exclaims,
“It is not a finger-ring.” One of the players will imitate
wringing of clothes. The leader says, “It is not wring.”
Another represents singing, and is told “it is not sing.” A
player will perhaps imitate a bee stinging. Then the leader
exclaims, “Sting is the word, I resign my place to you.”
Perhaps a few examples of rhyming words easily acted may
be useful, which will be given here.</p>

<p class="psh">AN EXHIBITION OF THE MODERN GIANT.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is rare sport, when well managed, and for a time the
exhibition appears very mysterious to the uninitiated. A
large sheet should be strained across some open door; folding
doors are better adapted to this game, as they give a
larger space for action.</p>

<p>The room in which the spectators are seated should be
darkened; but in the room back of the curtain, where the
Giant exhibits, should be placed on the floor, a bright lamp
or candle, with a reflector, either of polished tin or a looking
glass. Any one standing between the light and curtain, appears
immense in all his proportions, as his reflection is cast
upon the sheet. Let the person acting as the Giant first open
his hands and spread his fingers wide, and let them appear at
the bottom of the curtain, and gradually rise till the shadow
of his whole body is exhibited between the light and the curtain.
He will appear to rise from the cellar; then let him
jump over the light, to the rear of the reflector, and it will
seem as if he jumped upwards through the ceiling.</p>

<p>Many amusing scenes can be thus contrived, articles of
furniture, etc., etc., can be called down from above by simply
passing them over the light. Dolls can be used with great
effect. The Giant can appear to swallow them&mdash;or destroy
the pigmy race. Care should be taken to keep the profile
on the screen or curtain as distinct as possible. Some call
this game “The man in the moon came down too soon.”</p>

<p class="psh">THE SHADOW AT COMMAND.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> feat is performed by means of confederacy. Having
privately apprised your confederate that when you strike one
blow, it signifies the letter A; when you strike two, it means
B; and so on for the rest of the alphabet; you state to the
company that if any one will walk into the adjoining room,
and have the door locked upon him, perhaps the animal may
appear which another person may name. In order to deter
every one except your confederate from accepting the offer,
you announce at the same time that the person who volunteers
to be shut up in the room must be possessed of considerable
courage, or he had better not undertake it. Having
thus gained your end, you give your confederate a lamp,
which burns with a very dismal light, telling him, in the
hearing of the company, to place it on the middle of the
floor, and not to feel alarmed at what he may happen to see.
You then usher him into the room, and lock the door. You
next take a piece of blank paper and a pencil, and, giving
them to one of the party, you tell him to write the name of
any animal he wishes to appear to the person shut up in the
room. This being done, you receive back the paper, and
after showing it around to the company, you fold it up, burn
it in the candle or lamp, and throw the ashes into a mortar
(an iron one is the best), casting in at the same time a powder,
which you state to be possessed of valuable properties.
Having taken care to read what was written, you proceed to
pound the ashes in the mortar, thus:  Suppose the word
written be “cat,” you begin by stirring the pestle around the
mortar several times, and then strike three distinct blows,
loud enough for your confederate to hear, and by which he
knows that the first letter of the word is C. You next make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
some irregular evolutions of the pestle around the mortar,
that it may not appear to the company that you give nothing
but blows, and then strike one blow for A. Work the pestle
about again, and then strike twenty blows, which he will
know means T&mdash;finishing your manœuvre by working the
pestle about the mortar, the object being to make the blows
as little remarkable as possible. You then call aloud to your
confederate, and ask him what he sees. At first he is to
make no reply; after being interrogated several times, he
asks if it is not a cat.</p>

<p>That no mistake be made, each party should repeat to himself
the letters of the alphabet in the order of the blows. If
he misses, you might go over, pretending you had forgotten
some word in your incantations, as you can mumble to yourself
when pounding. If your confederate is a good mimic,
it would add to the amusement of all to mimic the sounds of
the animal to appear to him.</p>

<p>I have seen this game differently performed. Your confederate,
after any word has been chosen, returns to the room,
and you give assurance that by your magical art you can
inform him of the word. You then take a cane and draw a
large circle, and at the same time repeat any absurd jingle or
formula of words; then pretend to call up some ancient
spirit, and by your raps on the floor tell your confederate your
first letter. Then pretend to draw magical figures, and repeat
anything you think of; pretend to listen for an answer; then
call up some different spirit, and by your distinct raps express
the second letter; and so on until the word is finished. This
game can be made very amusing.</p>

<p class="psh">THE WIZARD OF THE EAST.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> principal performer attires himself in a robe, a paper
cap, spectacles, and other appointments necessary to the outfit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of the “Wizard of the East.” He is armed with a magic
wand, by means of which he is supposed to exercise his mysterious
calling, and with which he makes a circle on the
ground, muttering at the same time the unearthly words of
some potent spell. After communing profoundly for some
moments with some imaginary familiar, he appears to have
decided, and touches one of his confederates with his wand,
ordering him to go to the other end of the room, and there
blindfold his eyes. This order executed, and the audience
satisfied that the confederate is really blindfolded, the wizard
orders him to guess the person on whom his wand shall rest.
The wizard then proceeds to touch several persons lightly
with the wand, saying at each, “The wand moves,” and at
length allows it to rest on the shoulder of <i>the one who spoke
last</i> (the key to the trick), exclaiming, “The wand rests.”
The confederate will at once name the person touched (who,
also being a confederate, has purposely spoken last). The
latter takes the place of the person blindfolded, and the
wizard goes through with the same form; his confederate exciting
them to talk, he again touches the one who spoke last;
the confederate names him correctly, and the person touched
is blindfolded in turn. Unless he understands the game, he
will have only chance to guide him, and will rarely guess
correctly. Those who fail, pay a forfeit. Sometimes one of
the confederates takes the place of the wizard, and further
mystifies the company. This game, though simple, often
puzzles a room full.</p>

<p class="psh">TO BRING A PERSON DOWN UPON A

weight you will bring him down upon a feather. You then
leave the room, and procuring a feather you give it to him,
and tell him you have performed your promise, that you engaged
to bring him down upon a feather, which you have
done, for there is the feather, and if he looks he’ll find down
upon it.</p>

After requesting the company to guess this riddle, and they
have professed themselves unable to do so, produce a nut, and
having cracked it, take out the kernel, and ask them if they
have ever seen it before; of course they answer no; you reply,
“Neither have I, and I think you will confess that nobody
else has ever seen it, and now no one shall see it again;”
saying which, you put the kernel into your mouth and eat it.</p>

She should be furnished with a muff, which she must hold

<p class="psh">STATUARY.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Statuary</span>, when personated by intelligent ladies and gentlemen,
can be made very amusing. Some witty gentleman,
well versed in statuary, takes the part of showman. He
first selects from the company those he wishes to assist him,
being careful to select only such as can best control their
countenances. After obtaining a number of sheets, he takes
possession of a parlor, shutting the rest of the company out.
He then arranges his assistants as statuary around the room as
quickly as possible, covering each one, or each group, with a
sheet; then throws open the door, and invites the company to
a rare exhibition of statuary. After making a grandiloquent
speech he uncovers a group, and gives as absurd a description
as possible; so on through the whole.</p>

<p>As fun is the chief object, take for example some tall plain
gentleman and place him with bow in hand for Cupid. For
Diogenes, take a large wash tub and a boy in it, &amp;c.
Another diversion is to cover some ladies and gentlemen all
but one eye with a sheet; then let the company guess who
they are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arrange</span> yourselves in a circle. The one who knows the
game takes a cane in his left hand and pounds upon the floor
with it, saying, “He can do little who can’t do this,” and
passes the cane with his right hand to his right hand neighbor,
who tries to do the same thing, but generally fails. The
catch consists in quickly changing the cane from the left to the
right hand before you pass it. Every one is then intent on
your manner of pounding the cane on the floor. Change
hands as carelessly as possible.</p>

<p class="psh">BROTHER! I AM BOBBED!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A person</span> who understands the game proposes to another,
who is ignorant of it, to be blinded with him and be “bobbed.”
After being blindfolded they sit down in two chairs placed
back to back. The one who knows the game then removes
the bandage from his eyes and ties a knot in his handkerchief.
The others join hands and go round them in a circle. The one
not blindfolded carelessly hits the other with his handkerchief.
The one struck of course, thinks himself hit by some one in
the circle, and exclaims, “brother, I am bobbed.” The other
says, “who bobbed you?” In answer he mentions the name
of some one in the ring. They all call out, “you are wrong,”
so he is bobbed till the fun is exhausted, he trying to guess
the person who hit him and expecting to change places when
he guesses correctly. The other pretends he is hit occasionally
and calls out he is bobbed. It requires a good-natured person
to take the joke pleasantly.</p>

<p class="psh">HOW DO YOU LIKE IT? WHEN DO YOU
LIKE IT? AND WHERE WILL YOU
PUT IT?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> difficulty of this game consists in guessing the meaning
of two or more nouns, which sound alike but have different
meanings, without any other help than the answers given
to the above questions. It is played in the following manner.
One of the company is sent out of the room and not recalled
until her companions have agreed upon two words of similar
sound, with which to puzzle her. When she comes in she
asks, “How do you like it?” One answers, “very much indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>”
or “I don’t like it early in the morning;” another
says, “It is too noisy;” another, “It is too fond of fine
clothes,” &amp;c. She then asks, “When do you like it?” One
answers, “At all times;” another, “When I feel hungry for
my dinner;” another, “I want it when walking alone;” another,
“When I want some wood brought for my fire,” &amp;c.
Lastly she asks, “Where would you put it?” One says, “I
would hang it;” another, “I would shut it up in a church-tower;”
another, “I would take it to a ball-room,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>From such answers a witty little girl may guess that belle
was the chosen word, (belle, a fashionable lady, and bell, an
instrument of sound.) Such as do not guess must pay a forfeit.
Many words might be chosen for this game, such as
hair, hare; reign, rain; date, a fruit and date a period of time;
whip to strike with, and whip to eat; pear, pair; heir, air;
ale, ail; mason a brick-layer, mason a member of a secret
society; beer, bier; see and sea.</p>

<p class="psh">THE BIRD-CATCHER.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> who join this game must be seated in a circle, first
choosing a bird-catcher, who takes his or her place in the centre.
He can give the name of a bird to each person, or each
can select one, but each one must represent some bird, and
one of the number must personate an owl. The bird-catcher
then tells a story, introducing the names of different birds.
Every bird when mentioned must immediately make a chirrup,
crow, screech or splutter, peculiar to its species. The slightest
delay or mistake is punished by a forfeit. Each player, until
the owl is mentioned, must rest his hands on his knees; but
when the owl is called, each player must instantly clasp his
hands behind him. The bird-catcher tries to seize the hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of one of the players before he raises it from his knee; if he
succeeds, the person so caught must pay a forfeit or take the
bird-catcher’s place, his name and place in the aviary being
taken by the late officer. If he fails to entrap any one, he
must pay a forfeit, and continue the story until he does, or
has paid a certain number of forfeits; another then takes his
place, either by lot or choice. The company must keep their
hands behind them until some other bird is mentioned, when
they must return them promptly. It is well to mention the
owl twice in succession, but no one must change the second
time; the owl must make his peculiar cry whenever he is
mentioned. The following is a list of available birds, with
sounds peculiar to them, taken from undoubted authorities:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Cock&mdash;“Cook a doodle doo.”</p>

<p>The Hen&mdash;“Cut, cut, cut, ca da cut.”</p>

<p>The Chicken&mdash;“Peep, peep, peep.”</p>

<p>The Turkey&mdash;“Gobble, obble obble.”</p>

<p>The Duck&mdash;“Quack, quack, quack.”</p>

<p>The Canary&mdash;“Pretty Dick.”</p>

<p>The Magpie&mdash;“Jack wants his dinner.”</p>

<p>The Sparrow&mdash;“Chip, chip.”</p>

<p>The Whippowill&mdash;“Whip po will.”</p>

<p>The Parrot&mdash;“Pretty Poll; Poll wants cracker.”</p>

<p>The Curlew&mdash;“Pe-wit, pe-wit.”</p>

<p>The Crow&mdash;“Caw, caw, caw.”</p>

<p>The Goose&mdash;“Hiss&mdash;s&mdash;s.”</p>

<p>The Raven&mdash;“Cro-a-ak.”</p>

<p>The Snowbird&mdash;“Chick-adee-dee.”</p>

<p>The Owl&mdash;“To-wit, to-wit, to-whoo.”</p>

<p>These sounds of course can be varied to suit the idea of the
performer. Parrot and magpie can be made to speak as they
wish. The raven may be made to say, “Never more,” according
to Poe’s poem. But the sounds agreed upon at the
beginning must not be changed during the game. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
amusement can be gained by giving appropriate names to
different persons. The owl could be given to the most
learned in the company. The best singer, the nightingale,
could be represented by a few bars of Jenny Lind’s melodies.
The magpie could be given to a great talker. When all are
ready the bird-catcher might commence in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>I went out the other morning with my gun and nets to
catch a few birds. I did not intend robbing a farm yard, but
on the top of a railing I saw a fine cock; (“Cock a doodle
do,”) there was nobody looking and I couldn’t resist it&mdash;when
up came an enormous turkey. (“Gobble, obble, obble.”)
Oh! Oh! said I, a turkey, (“Gobble, obble, obble”)&mdash;well
a turkey (“Gobble, obble, obble”) is worth
more than a little sparrow, (“Chip, chip,”) and there is
more to eat on it than on a curlew, (“Pewit, pewit,”) and
as I had made up my mind to steal a cock, (“Cock a doodle
do,”) why not a goose, (“His, s, s,”) or a turkey.
(“Gobble, obble, obble.”) I crept up to him, when all of
a sudden a rascally magpie (“Jack wants his dinner”) flew
out of a bush, making such an abominable noise that all the
birds in the air (general cry without moving the hands) took
flight at once. Off went the turkey (“Gobble, obble, obble”)
on one side and the cock (“Cock a doodle do”)
on the other, scattering a flock of ducks. (“Quack,
quack.”) There was not a single bird in sight but the owl.
(“To whit! to whit! to whoo.”) All hands up. [A forfeit
given either by the unlucky bird-catcher who has not
succeeded in catching a hand, or by a bird whose hand he has
caught; in either case, he who remains, or becomes bird-catcher,
continues.] As I was saying, the owl [dead silence
except the sound of the owl, all hands still behind] began
making an extraordinary noise, no doubt thinking himself the
nightingale, [the nightingale sings a bar from the “Daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of the Regiment;” all hands down on the knees immediately.
Forfeits from those too late, or in too great a hurry
to replace them,] and all the birds in the air [general cry]
flocked round again to see what the matter could be. Up
came the crow, (“Caw, caw,”) the raven, (“Croak,” or
“never more,” as agreed on) the wild duck, (“Quack!
quack!”) even the farmer’s parrot, (“Pretty Poll,”) in
fact, all the birds in the field, [dead silence.] “Oh! ho!”
I said, “now I shall put some salt on you,” when to my horror,
the beast of an owl&mdash;(“To whit, to whit, to whoo!”)&mdash;[all
hands disappear as before, and the bird-catcher darts forward
to catch some one. Whenever the bird-catcher says, “All
the birds in the air”&mdash;every bird must answer at once.]</p>

<p class="psh">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> take partners and sit opposite each other. Then one
person whispers a different question in the ear of each on one
side of the room, and another gives an answer to each on the
opposite side. The first couple commence. One asks the
question whispered to him, his partner gives the answer whispered
to her. Each couple take turn in giving the questions
and answers. A lady should direct the gentlemen, and a gentleman
the ladies. Each side asks the questions alternately,
the side that first asked the questions next making the answers.</p>

<p class="psh">THE MAGIC WAND.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> magician, or the person who wields the wonderful
wand, has a confederate who retires from the room. In his
absence, the company (the magician being present) agree
upon some piece of furniture or other article, by which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
powers of the wand are to be tested. He is then called in
and the magician points to various articles about the room.
Whenever he points to any article except the one agreed upon,
the confederate is sure to say “that is not it,” and he never
fails to designate the right article when the wand is pointed
towards it. This proceeding, which at first sight appears mysterious,
is easily explained. When the magician points to
the article agreed upon by the company he slightly changes
the position of the forefinger of the hand in which he holds
the wand, or makes some slight gesture previously agreed
upon by him and his confederate. The confederate looks intently
at every article pointed out and pretends to be thinking
deeply, while the company are generally so intent on following
his movements that they do not notice the almost imperceptible
motions of the magician. If one of the company
thinks he has detected the trick, he takes the confederate’s
place, and sometimes finds himself mistaken. If the magician
is a very mysterious personage he will be apt to magnetize
the confederate at the beginning of the game.</p>

<p>The “Black Art” is another form of the same game. The
magician next before pointing at the article agreed upon,
points towards some object of a black color, and in that way
gives the information to his confederate.</p>

<p class="psh">THE RHYMING GAME.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Where</span> several are passing an evening quietly together,
this game may afford much amusement. It is played as follows:
Each one of the company writes a single word on a
slip of paper; the more unusual and difficult the word is to
rhyme with, the more amusement it makes. These slips of
paper are placed in a hat, and each one of the company, in
turn, draws one, and then writes a couplet, in which the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
drawn shall stand at the end of a line, and the word at the
end of the other line shall rhyme with it. Of course, each
may write as much more as he pleases. Where the company
are witty and ready, and have a faculty of making verses
easily, the game is a pleasant one. Epigrams on the company
present, puns and good-natured hits, add much to the fun
in this game.</p>

<p class="psh">THE GAME OF TWENTY QUESTIONS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is one of the best of the games, though but little
known. Such men as Canning, Wyndham and Pitt have
played it; the latter two, indeed, were especially fond of it;
so it does not lack recommendation. The rules of the game
and its description are briefly these:</p>

<p>Two persons (usually a lady and gentleman), chosen by
the company, privately fix upon an article or subject. Two
others are then chosen to discover the subject so agreed upon,
and they must do this by asking twenty questions as to its
nature and qualities. A fifth person is usually selected as
umpire, who is made acquainted with the subject fixed upon,
and whose duty it is to see that all the questions are fairly
put and answered. The questions are to be put plainly,
though in the alternative, if desired, and the answers must be
plain and direct. The object of the thoughts must not be an
abstract idea, or anything so occult, or scientific, or technical,
as to be beyond the reasonable information of the company,
but something well known to the present day, or to general
history. It may be, for example, any name of renown,
ancient or modern, or any well known work or memorial of
art, but not a mere event, as a battle, for instance. Of
course, the discovery, if made, is to be the fair result of mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
inference from the questions and answers, not of signs
passing, or juggling of any description.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt is said to have once succeeded in this game, when
the subject was <i>The stone upon which Walworth, Lord Mayor
of London, stood, when he struck down Wat. Tyler, in
Richard II.’s time</i>!</p>

<p>In a game in which Mr. Canning was the questioner, the
questions and answers were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First.</i>&mdash;Does what you have thought of belong to the
animal or vegetable kingdom?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;To the vegetable.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i>&mdash;Is it manufactured, or unmanufactured?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Manufactured.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i>&mdash;Is it a solid, or a liquid?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;A solid.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i>&mdash;Is it a thing entire in itself, or in parts?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Entire.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i>&mdash;Is it for private use, or public?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Public.</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i>&mdash;Does it exist in England, or out of it?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;In England.</p>

<p><i>Seventh.</i>&mdash;Is it single, or are there others of the same
kind?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Single.</p>

<p><i>Eighth.</i>&mdash;Is it historical, or only existent at present?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Both.</p>

<p><i>Ninth.</i>&mdash;For ornament, or use?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Both.</p>

<p><i>Tenth.</i>&mdash;Has it any connection with the person of the
king?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;No.</p>

<p><i>Eleventh.</i>&mdash;Is it carried, or does it support itself?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;The former.</p>

<p><i>Twelfth.</i>&mdash;Does it pass by succession? [Not answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
on account of uncertainty; but, by agreement, the question
was counted one in the progress of the game.]</p>

<p><i>Thirteenth.</i>&mdash;Was it used at the coronation?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p><i>Fourteenth.</i>&mdash;In the hall or abbey?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Probably, in both; certainly in the abbey.</p>

<p><i>Fifteenth.</i>&mdash;Does it belong specially to the coronation, or
is it used at other times?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;It is used at other times.</p>

<p><i>Sixteenth.</i>&mdash;Is it exclusively of a vegetable nature, or is
it not in some parts a compound of a vegetable and a mineral?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Exclusively of a vegetable nature.</p>

<p><i>Seventeenth.</i>&mdash;What is its shape? [Objected to, as too
particular; withdrawn by the questioner and therefore not
counted.]</p>

<p><i>Seventeenth, repeated.</i>&mdash;Is it decorated, or simple? [Objected
to, but objection not sustained.]</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Simple.</p>

<p><i>Eighteenth.</i>&mdash;Is it used at the ordinary ceremonial of the
House of Commons or House of Lords?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;No.</p>

<p><i>Nineteenth.</i>&mdash;Is it ever used by either House?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;No.</p>

<p><i>Twentieth.</i>&mdash;Is it generally stationary, or movable?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Movable.</p>

<p>Answer, guessed correctly at the end of the twentieth question:
“<i>The wand of the Lord High Steward</i>.”</p>

<p class="p1">When all the answers have been written, the papers are
collected by the President. No one is to see what answers
have been written by any other person. After shuffling them
together, the President reads them aloud, and each player
guesses as to the authorship of each paper. Forfeits are
sometimes collected, and the game prolonged in that way.
This game cannot be well played except by persons who are
well acquainted with each other.</p>

<p class="psh">YORK AND LANCASTER, OR THE WAR
OF THE ROSES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> game is commenced by the choice of two Commanders,
either by lot or by vote. As it is necessary for the success
of the game to select the most skillful as the Commanders,
each player should carefully consider the merits of all the
others before casting his vote. One Commander is called
Duke of York, and the other Duke of Lancaster. The Commanders
draw lots for the first choice of men, and each Duke
selects alternately a man from the players till the whole are
drawn.</p>

<p>Each party marks out its fort by drawing semicircular
lines; the forts should be in line, twenty paces apart, and
each of them sufficiently large to hold easily one of the armies.
Twenty paces in front of each fort should be drawn a
semicircle larger than the fort, which is called the prison,
the prisons and forts thus marking the four corners of a square.</p>

<p>The two Dukes then draw lots to decide which shall commence
the game. If the Duke of York wins, he sends out
one of his red-rose men, usually a new player, who must run
at least beyond the line of the prison before he returns. As
soon as he has started the other Duke sends out one of his
men to pursue, and, if possible, to touch the red-rose runner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
before he can regain his own fort. If this is accomplished,
the successful runner returns to his fort, while the vanquished
party must go to the enemy’s prison, from which he cannot
stir until some one from his own side releases him, by touching
him in spite of the enemy. This is not an easy task, as
in order to reach the enemy’s prison, the player must pass by
the enemy’s fort. It is allowable for the prisoner to stretch
his hand as far towards his rescuer as possible, but he must
keep his body within the bounds; and if several prisoners are
taken, it is sufficient for one to remain within the prison, while
the rest, by joining hands, make a chain towards the player
who is trying to release them. [The Commanders in the
commencement of the game must decide if they will allow
this latter mode of escape.] When a rescue is thus accomplished,
both the prisoner and his rescuer return to their fort,
no one being allowed to touch them until they have reached
then fort and again started out.</p>

<p>But the game is not restricted to the two originally sent
out. As soon as either Duke sees one of his men pressed by
an opponent, he sends out a third, who is in his turn pursued
by another from the opposing side; each being allowed to
touch any who have preceded, but none who have left their
fort after him. The war soon becomes exciting; prisoners
are made and released, the two Dukes watching the game,
and rarely exposing themselves, except in cases of emergency,
but directing the whole proceedings. The game is considered
won, when one party has succeeded in imprisoning the whole
of the other side.</p>

<p>Much depends upon the Commanders, who sometimes, by
a bold dash, rescue the most important of their men, and
thereby turn the fate of the battle; or when the attention of
the opposite side is occupied by some hardly-contested struggle,
send out a player who walks quietly up to the prison,
and without attracting the notice of the opposing party, lets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
out a prisoner. No player is permitted to touch more than
one person until he has returned to his fort; when he can
sally out again, armed with fresh strength, like Antæus of
old, who could not be conquered at wrestling because whenever
he touched the ground his strength was renewed by his
Mother Earth.</p>

<p class="psh">POST-OFFICE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> family game is instructive as well as amusing. Each
one present writes a poem, anecdote, essay, or a letter to some
person either present or absent. The articles written should
be concise and must in all cases be original. Any one who
chooses to do so can disguise his handwriting. The papers,
as they are completed, are carefully folded and directed, and
then deposited in a covered box placed on the table.</p>

<p>The post-master must be chosen by the company. He has
the right to open all the letters and papers, first announcing
to whom each is directed, and reads them aloud. After the
reading, the papers are distributed according to the directions
written upon them.</p>

<p>Young people who write for the “family portfolio” soon
become very much interested in it, and find themselves acquiring
a ready use of the pen.</p>

<p class="psh">GRACES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> also is an old game, but should be revived, as it is as
beneficial as many of the exercises in the gymnasium, and
quite as <i>graceful</i>. It is of German origin, and can be played
in the open air, or in any hall or long room.</p>

         title="" />
</div>

<p>To play the game you need four smooth, round sticks nearly
three-quarters of a yard long. The stick at one end should
be just large enough to be grasped firmly by the hand, and
should be tapered gradually to the end. These sticks, or
grace wands, may be prettily painted and wound near the
large end, where they are held, with fancy ribbons. The
hoops are from ten to twelve inches in diameter, made of some
light wood, as bamboo, covered with bright colored silks and
wound with silver cord or some tinsel chenille.</p>

<p>The game is usually played by only two players, each taking
two wands and one hoop, and standing at a distance from each
other; the two wands are held in the hands across each other
like open scissors. The object is to throw and catch the hoop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
upon these wands. When trying to catch the hoop the sticks
are held like scissors shut, and are opened apart when the
hoop is thrown from you. If you can crown your opponent
without her catching the hoop, a kiss is the old-established forfeit.
The object of the game, as in “Shuttlecock and Battledoor,”
is to keep both hoops flying without once touching the
floor. Beginners had better first play with only one hoop.</p>

<p class="psh">FAMILY NEWSPAPER.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is an excellent pastime for a large family, or several
families can unite in it. Choose the most ready writer, and
the person of the best judgment among your number, for the
editor. He must also be a good penman. Your paper can
be a weekly or a monthly journal as you please. Every member
of the family must contribute one or more articles for the
paper, either serious, laughable, instructive or absurd pieces,
and give to the editor in season for him to arrange his paper,
and publish it at the appointed time. Such as wish to conceal
their authorship must notify the editor, and he is bound
in honor not to reveal the name of any writer without his permission.
Large sheets can be procured, or two or more small
ones can be used together. The paper can then be read aloud
to the family, or each can read it separately. The family paper
will be found to add another link to the home chain. All
the papers thus prepared should be carefully preserved, and
in after years they will prove a source of pleasure. Most
vividly will they bring by-gone days before you.</p>

<p>A friend of mine lately told me of a newspaper of this
description, edited by a nephew only eleven years of age.
She said that its perfect regularity and neatness were beautiful
to see. He printed the whole with a pen, and it was arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
in proper newspaper form. The leading editorials
first, followed by a letter from abroad, anecdotes, terrible accidents,
telegraph news, marriages, deaths, advertisements,
etc., etc. He was one of a family of nine. Every member
of the family wrote for it, even a little girl of six wrote an
anecdote about her pet lamb.</p>

<p class="dc13">SQUAILS is a modern English game. The
incompleteness of the original rules, and the
ridiculous terms employed in the game have
prejudiced many sensible people against it.
Relieved of these absurdities, the game is an
interesting one.</p>

<p class="psh font1">Materials.</p>

<p>The materials for this game consist of sixteen
squails, a target, and a gauge. The squails are small
discs of wood, about two inches in diameter, eight of light
and eight of dark colored wood. The squails are designated
by four distinct colors&mdash;two light and two dark of each color.
The target is of ivory, about one inch in diameter, and loaded
so as not to be easily moved or overturned. The gauge is a
measure three inches long, made with a convenient handle.</p>

<p>The method of the game is as follows:  The company
being seated around a dining table, the squails are distributed
to them, and the target placed in the center of the table.
Now the object of each player is to drive his squails as near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the target as possible, by allowing the squail to project over
the side of the table about one-fourth its size, and striking it
with the palm of the hand.</p>

the opposite side from the player striking it, is “out.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Rout.</span>&mdash;To strike a collection of enemy’s squails so

<p><span class="smcap">To Blockade.</span>&mdash;To leave one’s squails in such a position
as to block up a passage in which the next hostile player
could play to advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Cut Out.</span>&mdash;To leave one’s squails between the target,
a hostile squail lying near it.</p>

<p class="psh font1">Rules.</p>

<p>The game of squails may be played by any number of
persons not exceeding eight. If the number of players is
even, half will play on one side and half on the other&mdash;one
side taking the light squails and the other the dark ones.
The players of the opposing sides must be seated alternately
round the table. If there is an uneven number of players,
there are no sides, and all are antagonistic to each other.</p>

<p>A captain is chosen on each side, to whom the players may
look for advice, and who shall decide the amount to be scored
at each round.</p>

<p>The first play, if there are sides, is determined by the two
captains playing one squail each at the target, the one who
drives his squail nearest to the target having the first play.
If an odd number play, each one plays in a like manner for
the lead. The lead being determined, the commencing player
places one of his squails about one quarter off the edge of
the table, and strikes it with the palm of his hand, aiming at
the target which is in the center of the table. The squails
slide on the surface of the table.</p>

<p>The players must play one at a time in rotation, with the
course of the sun&mdash;i. e. from right to left. When all the
squails have been played a round is finished, and the nearest
squail to the target counts one if within the distance of the
gauge. If more than one of the same side are nearer than
any of the other color, they all count one each, provided they
are within the distance of the length of the gauge&mdash;i. e.
three inches. A player can strike his squail from any
position around the table which he can reach without moving
from his chair, or rising from his seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>If the target is moved by a squail from its place, and does
not cross the line of demarcation, it must remain where it
stops, unless it is rolling and unsteady; in which case the
next player can stand it firmly in the place where he finds it,
and all must play at it in its new position till that round is
finished. Before commencing a new round the target must
be placed back to the center of the table.</p>

<p>At the end of a round, the captain of one side makes his
claim for so many “in,” and if the claim is disputed, the
gauge is used by the disputing captain to measure the distance
from the target to the disputed squails. If the captain
of the side who claims one or more squails “in” at the conclusion
of the round touches them before they have been
allowed by the captain of the opposition, the squail or squails
so touched are null, and do not count towards the game. The
winner of one round begins the next.</p>

<p>If the target is struck across the line of demarcation, i. e.
“out,” it terminates that round; the person who sent it out
commences the next round, and one is added to the score of
the adversary.</p>

<p>The game can consist of any number agreed upon by the
players. Five is a short game, and eleven is a long one.</p>

<p>A squail having been struck so far on the table as not to
be touched by the gauge, measuring from the edge of the
table, is considered as played, and cannot be taken back. It is
then said to have passed the line of demarcation. If a squail
passes the line of demarcation twice, i. e. goes across the
table, one of the opposing side must cry, “That squail is
out,” before the next squail in succession has been played,
otherwise, the owner may claim it, and play it again at the
conclusion of the round. If more than one squail is “out,”
and not cried, they may all be claimed and played at the end
of the round in the order in which they were “out.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> materials of this game are one white ball, and a number
of other balls, designated by four distinct colors. It is
played as follows: Place the white ball on the floor near one
end of the room with perhaps a row of books behind it, to
protect the finish.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-226.jpg" width="400" height="280"

         title="" />
</div>

<p>Divide the remaining balls equally among the players, or give an equal
number of balls to each player. If four play, it is more interesting
to form sides, the two players on one side taking the dark balls,
and the other two the light ones. Blue and black are considered
dark&mdash;red and yellow, light. The players, retiring to some part
of the room more or less distant from the white ball, now bowl the
colored balls, which they hold, at the white one, by turns. Each player
bowls one ball at a time, the play passing around the company as many
times as there are colored balls for each player. The first bowl goes
by turn, as the last bowl is the most valuable. The object of each
player is to have the balls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
that he bowls rest as near as possible
to the white one, and also to drive his enemy’s balls away from the
white one, or the white one away from them. When all the balls have
been bowled, the ball that lies nearest the white one counts 4; the one
next nearest, 2; and the third nearest, 1&mdash;to the person or side
to which they belong. Thus, we will suppose that of the three balls
lying nearest to the white ball, the nearest one belongs to the dark
side, and the two next nearest belong to the light side. Then the dark
side scores 4, and the light side 2 and 1, making 3. But if the <i>three</i>
nearest balls had belonged to the dark side, they would have scored 7,
and the light side nothing. The game may be 20, or any other number
agreed upon by the players before commencing, and the player or side
that gains that number first wins the game. Should the game be nearly
equal, so that both sides gain 20 in the same hand, then the side that
makes the greatest number wins. The white ball must remain wherever
it is rolled by the playing of the balls during each hand and placed
back on some designated spot at the <i>commencement</i> of each hand. If two
balls belonging to opposite parties are equally distant from the white
ball, it is a tie, and the two players who bowled those balls must try
again, and the one whose ball is nearest will count 4, the other 3.</p>

<p class="psh">THE UNION GAME, OR RED, WHITE AND
BLUE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is an excellent parlor game. Any person possessing a
croquet board, by taking out the hoops, can use it for the
Union game, although a square or round board is better; if
square, the board should measure from three and a half to
four feet each way; if round, from three and a half to four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
feet in diameter. The board should be firmly made of well
seasoned wood, and covered with cloth or green baize. It
should have a rim or fence around the edge, just sufficient
to prevent the balls from rolling off the board. It is necessary
to have three cubes made of some light wood, about
an inch and a half each way; one should be painted red, one
white, and one blue, with a star on each face.</p>

<p>Each player should have three balls, painted red, white
and blue, and a mallet. The balls and mallets may be the
same used in parlor croquet. If this game is played on a
board, it is necessary, in order to avoid any disputes, to have
a square marked in the centre in which to place the cubes.
A croquet board can be adapted to the game by removing the
central hoop.</p>

<p>All persons, who prefer not to use a board, can play the
game on the floor, by placing the cubes on some central figure
of the carpet. By using larger blocks and the croquet balls
and mallets, this game can be played on a level spot of
ground, in the open air.</p>

<p class="psh font1">How the Game is to be Played.</p>

<p>Place the red cube in the centre of the board, the white
diagonally on top of the red, and on top of the white place
the blue cube, with its sides square with the red. The person
to commence the game is chosen by lot. He places his
red ball at the distance of a mallet’s head from the edge of
the board, and tries to send his ball against the cubes in the
centre; he can roll his three balls in succession, and at the
end of his play take back his balls and replace the cubes, if
their position has been changed by his play. The player on
his left then plays his three balls, and each in turn, until all
have played. The same thing is repeated until three rounds
have been played.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p class="psh font1">Rules of the Game.</p>

<p>1.  Each player must play from the place he first selects,
and at the same distance from the cubes as the other players,
or forfeit his play.</p>

<p>2.  If a player with his red ball throws down the blue and
white cubes and moves the red cube over the square marked,
it counts him 20, and he need not play the white or blue ball,
but whatever points he wins during the second round with the
first two balls counts on the first roll.</p>

<p>3.  If a player only throws down the blue and white cubes
without moving the red from its square, he counts 15.</p>

<p>4.  If a player only knocks off the blue cube, he counts 10.</p>

<p>5.  If a player only moves the three cubes, he counts 5.</p>

<p>6.  If a player with the first two balls throws down two
cubes and moves the under red cube, his play is finished for
that round, and when his next turn comes, he can add what
he wins with the first ball to the count on his former play.</p>

<p>7.  If a player knocks the three cubes down in the three
rolls, he counts 20, and if he only knocks down two in three
rolls without moving the red, he counts 15; if only the blue
cube he counts 10; if he merely moves them all together he
counts 5 for the three balls; if he hits them but does not move
them he counts nothing.</p>

<p>8.  If in rolling the three balls at the cubes he misses
them every time, he loses 5 from his score.</p>

<p>One of the company should be provided with pencil and
paper and keep an accurate account of each player’s score.</p>

<p class="psh">ZOETROPE, OR WHEEL OF LIFE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Zoetrope is a newly invented toy. It presents a series
of striking optical delusions, and is constructed in part on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
principle of the Phenakestoscope, though altogether different
in its arrangement and effect. It can be exhibited on a table
in the middle of a room, and a dozen or more can be amused
by it at the same time, one of the party keeping it in motion.
The exhibitor can give such description of the pictures as they
appear as he thinks best. A bright boy or girl can add very
much to the interest of the exhibition by witty descriptions.
The exhibitor can announce his performance to a family party
in a high-flown handbill, charge an admission fee to the room,
and carry out the exhibition in the most approved style. The
toy is admirably adapted for the entertainment of children.</p>

<p class="psh">GRECIAN GAMES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> reading an account of the toys, sports and pastimes of
the ancient Greeks, one is surprised at their resemblance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
our own. They had many games now in common use, and
supposed to be of modern invention. A Grecian philosopher
named Archytas invented the child’s rattle.</p>

<p>Our children would like to revive the hoops of the ancient
Greeks. They surely were more tasteful than ours. I will
describe them, and perhaps some enterprising boy will try to
imitate, if not surpass them. They were made of bronze,
three feet in diameter, very light, and adorned with little
spherical bells and movable rings, which jingled musically as
the hoops rolled along; the hoop stick was crooked at the
point, and called a “plectron.”</p>

<p>Boys! do not be outdone by the young Greeks. Try and
invent a hoop with bells of different tones, that will play a
melody as it rolls. Some iron hoops have bells, but they are
not musical. The Egyptians, too, excelled in toys of all
kinds.</p>

<p class="psh">JACK-STRAWS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack-straws</span> were played centuries ago, and like many
other good old games, have come into fashion anew and with
some improvements. The game may be played with straws or
fine splinters of wood, four or five inches in length. The
straws are gathered in a bunch, not tied, but held firmly together
by one end of the bunch, in the hand, a few inches
above the table. Held in this manner the bunch will be
spread at the bottom, somewhat in the form of a haystack.
The player suddenly drops the bunch, and the straws fall in
an irregular heap on the table. Each player is provided with
a straw or stick, on one end of which a small hook or crooked
pin is made fast, and each in turn tries to draw with his hook
a single straw from the heap without moving in the slightest
degree, any straw except the one he seeks to remove. If he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
succeeds, he keeps the straw, and proceeds to draw out another
or others, but whenever he disturbs any other than the
one straw he gives up his turn to his opponent. The one
who gains the largest number of straws wins the game.</p>

<p>The jack-straws sold in the toy shops are usually made of
wood, and each bunch contains pieces roughly representing
kings, queens, bishops, &amp;c. Each of these pieces has a number
marked on it, and when one of them is drawn from the
heap, it counts for the player as many straws as its number
indicates. If the players so agree, each can gather up the
straws, as often as his turn comes, and drop them anew.</p>

<p class="dc13">DANCE, THUMBKIN, DANCE! is a game
by which an older person can amuse a number
of little children. It is played by holding
up the hand and bending thumb and fingers
in the following manner. First, put the
thumb in motion, singing in a lively tune,
“Dance, thumbkin, dance;” then keep the
thumb still and move the four fingers, singing,
“Dance, ye merry men, every one, for
thumbkin he can dance alone.” Then move
the forefinger and sing, “Dance, foreman, dance!” Then
move all the fingers, singing, “Dance, ye merry men, every
one, for foreman he can dance alone.” Then keep the second
finger in motion, singing, “Dance, middleman, dance!”
Then move all the fingers, singing, “Dance, ye merry men,
every one, for middleman he can dance alone.” Then in the
same manner repeat the process with the two other fingers,
calling the third finger “ring-man,” and the fourth finger
“little-man.” When these changes are done rapidly, it entertains
even babies.</p>

<p class="psh">UNCLE JOHN.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> the children who join this game must stand in a circle
holding each others’ hands, and as they walk or dance around
they sing the following words:</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">“Uncle John is very sick. What shall we send him?<br />
A piece of pie, a piece of cake, a piece of apple dumpling.<br />
What shall we send it in? In a golden saucer.<br />
Who shall we send it by? By the king’s daughter.<br />
D-o-w-n, down.”</p>

<p class="p1">Then all must kneel down as quickly as possible, and rise up
at once, the one who is the last to kneel must, when they all rise,
whisper to some one a girl’s or boy’s name, and then all join
in the circle, the one who knelt last facing outwards. Then
they all repeat as follows, making use of the name whispered:</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">“J&mdash;&mdash; B&mdash;&mdash; so they say<br />
Goes a courting night and day,<br />
Sword and pistol by his side,<br />
M&mdash;&mdash; L&mdash;&mdash; shall be his bride,<br />
She has sparks, one, two, three,<br />
I can tell you who they be,<br />
Joel, Toel, half a day,<br />
Exel, Toel, turn away.”</p>

<p class="p1">All again commence to sing “Uncle John is very sick,”
&amp;c., this continues until each one faces outwards in turn or
they are weary of it.</p>

<p class="psh">MOTHER GOOSE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a new and amusing game for little children. One
among their number must be chosen to take the part of
“Mother Goose,” and she must arrange her forces in a line,
and place a cricket in the centre of the room. She then leads
off, clapping her hands and dancing slowly, saying, “Hi, diddle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
diddle, the cat’s in the fiddle.” All must follow her,
saying and acting exactly as she does, on penalty of a forfeit.
She then imitates the mewing of a cat and all imitate her.
She then repeats “the cow jumped over the moon,” and
“Mother Goose” runs and jumps over the cricket, all the
others following her. Again they pass round the room singing,
“The little dog laughed to see the sport.” Suddenly
she stops and laughs heartily, each one imitating her, and
away they go again, singing, “The dish ran away with the
spoon.” “Mother Goose” then claps her hands as a signal
for all to run, and off they start, she after them; if she succeeds
in catching one, she cries out, “Here is Mother Goose,”
and all assemble round her, and the play commences again.
If played in the open air, it is well to have some post or tree
as a goal, and if “Mother Goose” does not catch some one
before it is reached, she has to act her part again.</p>

<p class="psh">“CLAP OUT AND CLAP IN.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> the girls in the party arrange themselves behind chairs,
sofas, ottomans, &amp;c., all the boys being sent out of the room,
one girl stands as door-keeper. Some girl then calls out the
name of a boy whom she wishes to take the seat in front of
her, the door-keeper opens the door and calls out the name.
The boy called enters and the door is shut; he looks all around
wondering who has chosen him, and finally takes a seat. If
he happens to sit down in front of the girl who called his
name she kisses him, and he keeps his seat; but if not, as is
most likely to be the case, they all clap him out, and away
he goes. Another is then chosen and the same thing is gone
through; sometimes a favorite boy will be called in a number
of times before he guesses correctly. When all the girls have
taken their turn in calling, they leave the room, and the boys
take their stand behind the seats, and the girls are called in.</p>

of the leader, and join him in singing. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
leader is ready to commence the game he must clap his hands.
He then begins to move his fore-finger and thumb, and sings
the words as arranged at the beginning of these directions.
All the motions he makes must correspond with the words he
sings, and each player must imitate his motions, and continue
them through the game. All the fingers, thumbs, arms, feet
and heads in the room will soon be in motion. The effect of
this game is quite laughable. The persons joining in this
play can recite the words without singing, if they prefer.</p>

<p class="psh">“YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A GOOSE.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> play consists in telling a story for the amusement of
little children, and at the same time drawing figures on a slate
or paper in illustration of it. For instance, “An old man and
his wife lived in a little cabin. I will draw it with my pencil,
so that you may know it. There it is, (here make a picture
of the cabin.) This cabin had a window, which I will
make thus, (here put in the window.) Near the window was
a projecting door, like this, (here put in the door.) On the
side opposite the door was a road, bordered on one side by a
hedge, (draw the road and hedge.) This road terminated in
a large pond, (mark out the pond,) and herbs grew round it,
(mark them.) One night some robbers came to the further
end of the pond, (make some marks for robbers.) The old
woman heard them and told her husband to get up and see
what was the matter. The old people walked down to the
side of the pond, (make marks for the old people on the side
of the pond.) Each of them held out a hand to caution the
other to keep silence, (mark the hands.) But they did not
hear anything, for the robbers had taken fright and had run
away. After standing out in the cold for a long time, the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
man said to his wife, ‘Go along back to the house, you are
nothing but a goose.’ At this point you hold up your paper
and it will be seen that you have made a picture of a goose.
The subjoined cut illustrates the progress of the picture.”</p>

<p>While telling the story you must be careful that the lookers-on
see the growing picture sideways, or upside down; otherwise
they may suspect your design before the picture is complete.
Other simple stories can be illustrated in like manner.</p>

<p class="psh">BUZZ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Promptness</span> is very necessary in this game. Any number
of children excepting seven, both girls and boys, seat themselves
round a table, or in a circle. One begins the game by
saying, “One!” the child on the left says “two!” so on till
they come to seven, which number must not be mentioned,
but in place thereof the word “Buzz!” Whenever a number
occurs in which the figure seven is used or any number into
which seven may be multiplied, “Buzz” must be used instead
of that number. Such are the numbers, 7, 14, 17, 21, 27,
28, 35, 37, 42, &amp;c., &amp;c. Any one mentioning a number
with seven in it instead of “Buzz,” or calling out of turn, or
naming a wrong number, must pay a forfeit. After she has
paid her forfeit, she calls out, “One!” and so it goes round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
again to the left. When by a little practice the circle gets as
high as seventy-one, then, “Buzz one,” “Buzz two,” &amp;c., must
be used, and for seventy-seven, “Buzz-Buzz,” and so on. If
the person whose turn it is to speak delays longer than while
any one of the circle can moderately count five, she must pay
a forfeit.</p>

and pieces of cotton cloth, calico or muslin-delaine, ribbons,
&amp;c., with which to make dresses; and do not buy elegantly
dressed dolls, which can only be used on great occasions. I
will tell you how a little girl I once knew played dolls. Her
first doll was a “rag baby” that her aunt made and dressed
for her, like a real child. She had even a night-dress and
cap. She would amuse herself by hours together, dressing,
undressing and singing it to sleep; she would have it in her
arms every night. As she grew older she carefully treasured
all bits of finery, and everything she could manufacture into
clothing for her doll. A little girl lived near and they used
to visit daily with their dolls. Christmas always added to
their treasures, and they finally concluded to join forces and
commence a baby-house on a large scale in a spare room.
They had a parlor, dining-room, bed-rooms, kitchen and pantry,
all completely furnished, and a dozen nice dolls. Every
leisure moment was spent in this baby-house. They had regular
washings and ironings. They had little tubs and flat-irons
of their own. They baked bread, cookies and ginger-cakes,
for their mother’s cook would good-naturedly show them how
to mix and make wee bits of loaves. A thimble was often
used as a cookie or biscuit cutter.</p>

<p>Such plays give girls a taste for domestic employments, and
aid them in becoming good housekeepers, and good housekeeping
is always a desirable and sometimes a very necessary
accomplishment.</p>

<p>They would often “play school,” and in asking questions,
and answering for their dolls, the lessons they were taught at
school, were more firmly impressed on their minds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>If they had birthday parties, company was always invited
at two; and their “party” (that is, refreshments,) were
served at half-past four in Winter, and five in Summer.
Beaux they did not think of. If little boys joined them, they
were their playmates, and no more. They always took their
dolls, and after playing simple games they would resort to
them as their chief amusement.</p>

<p class="psh">BOYS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> boys desire a hammer, nails, boards, &amp;c., do not deny
them. When a baby girl commences to play with a doll, a
baby boy will pound, or pretend to hammer nails, or drive
horses. It is useless to attempt to make boys love quiet sports.
Set aside some spare spot in your house, where the noise will
not disturb your household, or, what is better, build a little
work-room especially for their use. It will be money well invested.
Thus by early cultivating their tastes and by giving
them employment, seed may be sown which will yield an
abundant harvest.</p>

<p>Mothers! do not, by yielding to your over-sensitive nerves,
stupefy your boys. If they are good for anything, they must
and will make a noise. It is better to let them have a place
of their own, but you should frequently inspect their work or
play, and let them see you are interested in all they do. If
they make you a flower frame, praise it, and if they show
a taste for mechanics suggest to them other useful articles to
be constructed, such as boxes, silk-winders, &amp;c. When you
make presents give them tools. Encourage them also by judicious
rewards, to keep their room neat and their tools in order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>The following simple directions for making a few useful
articles may be of service to boys who like to exercise their
mechanical ingenuity.</p>

<p class="psh font1">Flower Frames.</p>

<p>Simple frames are made by taking two long narrow strips
of wood and several small ones of different lengths, and nailing
the latter to the long ones at equal distances apart, or a
still better way is to make holes in the long strips and insert
the ends of the short ones. When they are finished paint
them green. These frames can be made in the form of a
partly opened fan. A square frame can easily be made. The
prettiest frames are made of willows, wire, or rattans. Take
strips of wood and burn or bore holes through them at equal
distances. Then insert the wire, or rattan, or willow, and
twist them around in different forms, fastening the ends firm;
then paint or varnish them.</p>

<p class="psh font1">Boxes.</p>

<p>Pretty boxes can be made of any common wood, by simply
staining them with asphaltum varnish. Then varnish with
several coats of copal. After they are well dried, take some
pumice-stone and polish them. If necessary, varnish carefully
once again. Your common pine wood will then be
turned into black walnut, highly polished. Picture frames,
brackets, little book-racks, stands, crickets, and even sleds
and wagons can easily be made by an ingenious boy, and
stained in this manner or painted. Your sisters can ornament
them with leather work made to imitate carved wood. If you
are puzzled in making any of these articles, go to any workshop
and the workmen will tell you how to make them, if you
speak properly to them. Never say, my dear boys, you have
nothing to do.</p>

<p class="psh">PLAY-GROUND RHYMES.</p>

<p class="psh">FORFEITS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A great</span> many games for children and older persons end in
forfeits. A few hints in regard to them may be of service.
It is very foolish for any one to join a game unless he is willing
to forget himself for the time, and join heartily in it. The
game of forfeits, if well played, is amusing to old and young.
Every one should be willing to redeem his or her forfeit without
stopping to think whether it is foolish or not. A good,
hearty laugh is healthful, and every sensible person ought to
be willing to take his turn in amusing the company. A whole
game may be ruined by the absurd actions of some one who
foolishly refuses to redeem his forfeit, for fear of lowering his
dignity or making himself ridiculous.</p>

<p>In choosing a judge of forfeits, it is necessary to select a
person of quick perceptions and ready wit. The judge must
be prompt in giving his decisions, and they who redeem their
forfeits must be as expeditious as possible. Promptness is
necessary to the success of all games. The following list of
forfeits, collected from various sources, may assist the judge:</p>

<p>Let the judge give out a line with which the one who owns
the forfeit shall make another line to rhyme, no matter how
absurdly.</p>

<p>Laugh first, sing next, then cry, and lastly whistle.</p>

<p>Place your hands behind you and guess who touches them;
you are not to redeem your forfeit till you guess right.</p>

<p>Stand with your heels and back close to the wall, then
stoop without moving your feet, and pick up the forfeit.</p>

<p>Say “Quizzical, quiz, kiss me quick,” nine times without
a mistake.</p>

<p>Ask the person who owns the forfeit, what musical instrument
he likes best; then require him to give an imitation of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Ask the person what animal he likes best; then require
him to imitate it, either by action or sound.</p>

<p>If a gentleman, he must put on a lady’s bonnet, and imitate
the voice and manner of the lady to whom it belongs.
If a lady, then she must take a gentleman’s hat and imitate
his manner, (sometimes these imitations are very humorous.
The use of some word or expression habitually employed by
the person imitated adds largely to the sport.)</p>

<p>Go to service; apply to the person who holds the forfeit for
a place as maid of all work. The questions then to be asked
are: “How do you wash?” “How do you iron?” “How
do you make a bed?” “How do you scrub the floor?”
“How do you clean knives and forks?” &amp;c. The whole of
these processes must be imitated by motions, and if the replies
are satisfactory the forfeit must be given up.</p>

<p>Put two chairs back to back, take off your boots or shoes
and jump over them. (The fun consists in a mistaken idea
that the chairs are to be jumped over instead of the shoes.)</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">
It is said there is a person you have loved since a boy,<br />
Whose hand you must kiss ere I give you this toy,<br />
It is not your father, or mother, or sister,<br />
Nor cousin, nor friend, take care not to miss, sir.</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">[<i>Himself.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">Make a low courtesy to each one in the room: if it is a
gentleman, he must make a bow.</p>

<p>Recite several of Mother Goose’s melodies.</p>

<p>Make wry faces at every person in the room.</p>

<p>Admire yourself in the mirror.</p>

<p>Shiver and act the part of a person half frozen, or pretend
to be nearly suffocated with heat.</p>

<p>Rush around the room and greet every one as if you had
just arrived from a long and dangerous voyage.</p>

<p>If a gentleman, act the part of a village orator; if a lady,
act the strong-minded woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>(A gentleman’s and lady’s forfeit can be given together in
many cases, making it more amusing as well as expeditious.)</p>

<p>Sing a song or repeat some high-flown poetry.</p>

<p>Perform the laughing gamut without a pause or mistake:</p>

<p class="p1">Keep silence and preserve a sober face for several minutes,
without regard to what may be said or done.</p>

<p>Kiss your shadow in every corner of the room without
laughing.</p>

<p>Repeat, without mistake, any difficult sentence which the
judge appoints.</p>

<p>Say to each person in the room, “You can’t say boo to a
goose.”</p>

<p>Tell the person to point out on a wall what he supposes to
be the height of an ordinary hat. If after measuring with a
hat, he has (as is rarely the case,) guessed right, he wins his
forfeit; but if not, he or she must wear the hat and bow or
curtsy to every one in the room.</p>

<p>Yawn till you make several others yawn. (It is well to
give this forfeit to one of the male sex with a large mouth.
A large circle of people may be made to yawn by simply
opening and closing the fingers slowly.)</p>

<p>Two can redeem their forfeits in this way. They must
stand in separate corners of the room, each holding a lighted
candle; one begins and walks toward the other, with her
handkerchief to her eyes, saying in a most dismal tone, “The
King of Morocco is dead! is dead!” The other in passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
by her, in the same attitude, sobs out, “Sad news! sad news!”
Again, in the same way, both exclaim, “Alas! alas!” All
must be said without laughing. The above penalty is often
used as a game.</p>

<p>Place a candle on a table or piano. Then blindfold the
person and place him just three paces from it, and directly
in front of the light. Then he must whirl around three
times, walk forward, and blow out the candle. This is amusing.
A room full of persons may try it unsuccessfully. Being
blinded, and then whirling around, bewilders one, and he
will very likely walk in an opposite direction, and perhaps
blow in some one’s face, feeling sure he is right.</p>

<p>A number of children may redeem their forfeits together, in

<p>Of all Card games ever invented, this one is perhaps the most
interesting, if it is not the most scientific. It is especially a card
game for the family circle, and familiar gathering of friends, calling
out at once the interest, skill and social nature of its players. As
a card game among ladies, it has no rival in their admiration.
Whether the game was originated in the brilliant Court of Louis
XIV., during the last part of the sixteenth century, by a Duchess&mdash;and
the term Bezique has a personal signification relative to a singular
marriage, which occurred at that time, of a lady of the highest
rank and great beauty, to a Duke named Bezique&mdash;cannot be clearly
affirmed, though it is accounted so, and appears quite likely, when
we consider that the Knave card represented Dukes in the original
game. Its origin is accredited to other sources, but we give the
above, as it is the only account we have been able to gather that
gives any explanation of the word Bezique. This game has been
revived in the last few years among the French, with some alterations
and additions, and has become a favorite Card amusement in
the fashionable circles of Paris life. In the meantime it has been
introduced in the United States, and, though at present it is played
only by the few in the higher circles of society, it is rapidly making
its popularity with all.</p>

<p>This Monthly, begun in January, 1865, has already won the reputation of
being “<b>the best Juvenile Magazine published in any land or language</b>.”
Prominent Educators, distinguished Clergymen of all denominations, and
the Press generally, have commended it in the highest terms. Its contents
are always thoroughly interesting and healthy, at once variously attractive
and useful.</p>

<p>The List of Contributors for 1867 will include, as heretofore, the names
of the most distinguished writers of the country, and the Publishers will
continue to rely for Illustrations upon the assistance of the best Artists
and Draughtsmen. Among the particular matters of interest that relate to
the new volume, may be mentioned the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The Leading Story</span> of the year will be contributed by <span class="smcap">Rev. Elijah Kellogg</span>,
author of the celebrated <i>Speech of Spartacus to the Gladiators</i>, etc., and will
be a vivid picture of the life of American boys and girls a century ago, preserving
the history of customs and manners which are now forgotten or
unknown, and enlivened with anecdote and incident.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe</span>, after completing <i>Little Pussy Willow</i>, will
continue her regular monthly contributions.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Round-the-World Joe</span>,” the popular contributor to the old “Schoolmate,”
has been engaged, and will furnish a series of articles of adventure and
observation in foreign countries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bayard Taylor’s</span> tales of distant lands will be continued.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A. M. Diaz</span> has written several articles, of which one, <i>William Henry’s
Letters to his Grandmother</i>, will be found especially entertaining.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Aunt Fanny</span>” has supplied several stories which will be printed during
the year.</p>

<p>P. H. C. will give several more of his favorite <i>Lessons in Magic</i>, some of
which will take up a different class of experiments from those that have
been previously explained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Music.</span>&mdash;<i>Each number</i> of the next volume will contain a song, composed
expressly for “Our Young Folks.” These songs will be written by <span class="smcap">Emily

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
